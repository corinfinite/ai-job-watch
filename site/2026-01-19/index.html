<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><div>
<div>
<h2>About the role:</h2>
</div>
<div>Running machine learning (ML) algorithms at our scale often requires solving novel systems problems. As a Performance Engineer, you'll be responsible for identifying these problems, and then developing systems that optimize the throughput and robustness of our largest distributed systems. Strong candidates here will have a track record of solving large-scale systems problems and will be excited to grow to become an expert in ML also.</div>
</div>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have significant software engineering or machine learning experience, particularly at supercomputing scale</li>
<li>Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact</li>
<li>Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description</li>
<li>Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)</li>
<li>Want to learn more about machine learning research</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts of your work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strong candidates may also have experience with:&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>High performance, large-scale ML systems</li>
<li>GPU/Accelerator programming</li>
<li>ML framework internals</li>
<li>OS internals</li>
<li>Language modeling with transformers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Representative projects:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement low-latency high-throughput sampling for large language models</li>
<li>Implement GPU kernels to adapt our models to low-precision inference</li>
<li>Write a custom load-balancing algorithm to optimize serving efficiency</li>
<li>Build quantitative models of system performance</li>
<li>Design and implement a fault-tolerant distributed system running with a complex network topology</li>
<li>Debug kernel-level network latency spikes in a containerized environment</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>Enterprise is central to Anthropic's mission. The organizations that could benefit most from Claude in healthcare, financial services, and government are often the most demanding buyers, with rigorous requirements around security, compliance, and control. We believe earning their trust is essential to ensuring AI benefits the world broadly.</p>
<p>We're looking for a software engineer to join our Enterprise Foundations team—the team that makes Claude enterprise-ready at scale. When a Fortune 500 company wants to roll out Claude to 50,000 employees, we're the team that makes it possible.</p>
<p>You'll build the foundational systems that large organizations require before they can deploy AI at scale: role-based access controls, enterprise identity integrations, admin experiences, and analytics infrastructure. This work directly converts product-market fit into revenue by removing the deployment blockers that prevent large organizations from adopting Claude broadly.</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of enterprise product, platform infrastructure, and go-to-market. You'll partner closely with product, design, sales, and customer success to understand what our largest customers need, then translate those requirements into scalable technical solutions that work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API.</p>
<h2><strong>Core Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and build permission infrastructure including groups-based access control, role management</li>
<li>Develop admin experiences that make complex access control intuitive—enabling admins to beta test features with pilot groups, set spend controls by department, and manage permissions at scale</li>
<li>Build enterprise analytics capabilities including on-demand reporting, usage analysis, and APIs that let enterprises integrate Claude data with their existing BI tools</li>
<li>Design, build, and ship enterprise-grade products with high standards for security, reliability, and scalability</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with Product Platform, Enterprise End User, GTM, and Verticals teams to ensure architecture works across all Anthropic products</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You Have</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with experience building enterprise SaaS platforms or admin tools</li>
<li>Strong background building identity and access management systems, including SSO integration, SCIM provisioning, or RBAC implementations</li>
<li>Experience designing systems that scale from small teams to large enterprise deployments</li>
<li>Track record of building products that successfully serve enterprise customers with demanding security and compliance requirements</li>
<li>Ability to work effectively across product, design, sales, and customer success functions</li>
<li>Motivation to work in a fast-moving environment where enterprise requirements evolve rapidly</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have</strong></h2>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have 1+ years of management experience in a technical environment, particularly performance or distributed systems</li>
<li>Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a similar related technical field</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers. The ideal candidate will have a passion for developer tools, extensive knowledge of diverse programming environments and languages, and experience with advanced LLM features like tool-use, chaining and orchestration patterns, and prompt engineering.

<li>Design, build, and maintain scalable features and infrastructure for AI-powered development tools</li>
<li>Engage directly with developers inside and outside Anthropic to gather insights and improve user experience</li>
<li>Collaborate with researchers to improve model capabilities through shared tools and evals</li>
<li>Stay ahead of advancements in AI-assisted coding by experimenting with new tools, evaluating emerging techniques, and tracking enhancements to existing ones</li>
<li>Contribute across the stack—from front-end UI to back-end infrastructure—to develop new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance</li>
<li>Dive into possibly unfamiliar areas like Python notebooks, VS Code plug-ins, and containerized environments.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Are excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity and creativity—not replace human ingenuity</li>
<li>Spend a lot of time refining and customizing your AI workflows</li>
<li>Have experience building and maintaining dev tools</li>
<li>Are an expert in React development, including performance optimization, modern patterns (hooks, context, suspense), and component architecture</li>
<li>Specialize in user experience engineering but are a capable full stack developer</li>
<li>Have hands-on experience working with large language models and prompt engineering</li>
<li>Have worked on projects with stringent safety, security and/or compliance requirements</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have experience with:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Building and maintaining CLI tools</li>
<li>Working in large codebases and quickly jumping in to unfamiliar development environments</li>
<li>Working with container orchestration and cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Scaling TypeScript projects</li>
<li>Working with alternate JavaScript runtimes like Bun and Deno</li>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

<li>Identify and prioritize key features that drive sustainable business growth</li>
<li>Own pricing, packaging, and enterprise go-to-market strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2>You might be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have combined 5+ years in product management, with experience launching new products and scaling existing technical products.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Possess a deep technical background with experience working cross-functionally with engineering teams to ship technical products. A data-driven mindset with Python and SQL working proficiency is a must.</li>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role:</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic's ML Performance and Scaling team trains our production pretrained models, work that directly shapes the company's future and our mission to build safe, beneficial AI systems. As a Research Engineer on this team, you'll ensure our frontier models train reliably, efficiently, and at scale. This is demanding, high-impact work that requires both deep technical expertise and a genuine passion for the craft of large-scale ML systems.</p>
<p>This role lives at the boundary between research and engineering. You'll work across our entire production training stack: performance optimization, hardware debugging, experimental design, and launch coordination. During launches, the team works in tight lockstep, responding to production issues that can't wait for tomorrow.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Own critical aspects of our production pretraining pipeline, including model operations, performance optimization, observability, and reliability</li>
<li>Debug and resolve complex issues across the full stack—from hardware errors and networking to training dynamics and evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Design and run experiments to improve training efficiency, reduce step time, increase uptime, and enhance model performance</li>
<li>Respond to on-call incidents during model launches, diagnosing problems quickly and coordinating solutions across teams</li>
<li>Build and maintain production logging, monitoring dashboards, and evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Add new capabilities to the training codebase, such as long context support or novel architectures</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with teammates across SF and London, as well as with Tokens, Architectures, and Systems teams</li>
<li>Contribute to the team's institutional knowledge by documenting systems, debugging approaches, and lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have hands-on experience training large language models, or deep expertise with JAX, TPU, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed systems</li>
<li>Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work—you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other</li>
<li>Are excited about being on-call for production systems, working long days during launches, and solving hard problems under pressure</li>
<li>Thrive when working on whatever is most impactful, even if that changes day-to-day based on what the production model needs</li>
<li>Excel at debugging complex, ambiguous problems across multiple layers of the stack</li>
<li>Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, especially when coordinating across time zones or during high-stress incidents</li>
<li>Are passionate about the work itself and want to refine your craft as a research engineer</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts of AI and responsible scaling</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Previous experience training LLM’s or working extensively with JAX/TPU, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks at scale</li>
<li>Contributed to open-source LLM frameworks (e.g., open_lm, llm-foundry, mesh-transformer-jax)</li>
<li>Published research on model training, scaling laws, or ML systems</li>
<li>Experience with production ML systems, observability tools, or evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Background as a systems engineer, quant, or in other roles requiring both technical depth and operational excellence</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Makes This Role Unique:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>This is not a typical research engineering role. The work is highly operational—you'll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities. You'll gain hands-on experience with some of the largest, most sophisticated training runs in the industry. You'll work alongside world-class researchers and engineers, and the institutional knowledge you build will compound in ways that can't be easily transferred. For people who thrive on this type of work, it's uniquely rewarding.</p>
<p>We're building a close-knit team of people who genuinely care about doing excellent work together. If you're someone who wants to be part of training the models that will define the future of AI—and you're excited about the full reality of what that entails—we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong>This role requires working in-office 5 days per week in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deadline to apply:</strong> None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.</p><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role:</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic's ML Performance and Scaling team trains our production pretrained models, work that directly shapes the company's future and our mission to build safe, beneficial AI systems. As a Research Engineer on this team, you'll ensure our frontier models train reliably, efficiently, and at scale. This is demanding, high-impact work that requires both deep technical expertise and a genuine passion for the craft of large-scale ML systems.</p>
<p>This role lives at the boundary between research and engineering. You'll work across our entire production training stack: performance optimization, hardware debugging, experimental design, and launch coordination. During launches, the team works in tight lockstep, responding to production issues that can't wait for tomorrow.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Own critical aspects of our production pretraining pipeline, including model operations, performance optimization, observability, and reliability</li>
<li>Debug and resolve complex issues across the full stack—from hardware errors and networking to training dynamics and evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Design and run experiments to improve training efficiency, reduce step time, increase uptime, and enhance model performance</li>
<li>Respond to on-call incidents during model launches, diagnosing problems quickly and coordinating solutions across teams</li>
<li>Build and maintain production logging, monitoring dashboards, and evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Add new capabilities to the training codebase, such as long context support or novel architectures</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with teammates across SF and London, as well as with Tokens, Architectures, and Systems teams</li>
<li>Contribute to the team's institutional knowledge by documenting systems, debugging approaches, and lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have hands-on experience training large language models, or deep expertise with JAX, TPU, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed systems</li>
<li>Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work—you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other</li>
<li>Are excited about being on-call for production systems, working long days during launches, and solving hard problems under pressure</li>
<li>Thrive when working on whatever is most impactful, even if that changes day-to-day based on what the production model needs</li>
<li>Excel at debugging complex, ambiguous problems across multiple layers of the stack</li>
<li>Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, especially when coordinating across time zones or during high-stress incidents</li>
<li>Are passionate about the work itself and want to refine your craft as a research engineer</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts of AI and responsible scaling</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Previous experience training LLM’s or working extensively with JAX/TPU, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks at scale</li>
<li>Contributed to open-source LLM frameworks (e.g., open_lm, llm-foundry, mesh-transformer-jax)</li>
<li>Published research on model training, scaling laws, or ML systems</li>
<li>Experience with production ML systems, observability tools, or evaluation infrastructure</li>
<li>Background as a systems engineer, quant, or in other roles requiring both technical depth and operational excellence</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Makes This Role Unique:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>This is not a typical research engineering role. The work is highly operational—you'll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities. You'll gain hands-on experience with some of the largest, most sophisticated training runs in the industry. You'll work alongside world-class researchers and engineers, and the institutional knowledge you build will compound in ways that can't be easily transferred. For people who thrive on this type of work, it's uniquely rewarding.</p>
<p>We're building a close-knit team of people who genuinely care about doing excellent work together. If you're someone who wants to be part of training the models that will define the future of AI—and you're excited about the full reality of what that entails—we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong>This role requires working in-office 5 days per week in London.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deadline to apply:</strong> None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.</p><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking for researchers to help mitigate the risks that come with building AI systems. One of these risks is the potential for models to interact with private user data. In this role, you'll design and implement privacy-preserving techniques, audit our current techniques, and set the direction for how Anthropic handles privacy more broadly.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lead our privacy analysis of frontier models, carefully auditing the use of data and ensuring safety throughout the process</li>
<li>Develop privacy-first training algorithms and techniques</li>
<li>Develop evaluation and auditing techniques to measure the privacy of training algorithms</li>
<li>Work with a small, senior team of engineers and researchers to enact a forward-looking privacy policy</li>
<li>Advocate on behalf of our users to ensure responsible handling of all data</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience working on privacy-preserving machine learning</li>
<li>A track record of shipping products and features inside a fast-moving environment</li>
<li>Strong coding skills in Python and familiarity with ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX.</li>
<li>Deep familiarity with large language models, how they work, and how they are trained</li>
<li>Have experience working with privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy and how it is different from k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness)</li>
<li>Experience supporting fast-paced startup engineering teams</li>
<li>Demonstrated success in bringing clarity and ownership to ambiguous technical problems</li>
<li>Proven ability to lead cross-functional security initiatives and navigate complex organizational dynamics</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have published papers on the topic of privacy-preserving ML at top academic venues</li>
<li>Prior experience training large language models (e.g., collecting training datasets, pre-training models, post-training models via fine-tuning and RL, running evaluations on trained models)</li>
<li>Prior experience developing tooling to support privacy-preserving ML (e.g., differential privacy in TF-Privacy or Opacus)</li>
</ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Product Dev Prod:&nbsp;</strong>We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You'll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Accounts Platform: </strong>We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic's product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust &amp; safety as customers. We create scalable solutions for user authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and single sign-on that form the backbone of our company's identity management operations. We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Claude Execution:</strong>&nbsp;We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="http://claude.ai/" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="http://Claude.ai" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Claude.ai</a>, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks.

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>Come work with us!</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the Role</h2>
<p>As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards focused on model launches, you'll be the critical bridge between Research, Inference, Product, and Safety teams during our highest-stakes model and product releases. You'll drive end-to-end execution of Safeguards deployment for model and product launches, ensuring our safety classifiers are properly configured, deployed, tested, and scaled across all platforms while balancing capacity constraints, performance requirements, and user experience considerations.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Own end-to-end safeguards readiness for model launches - Drive all safeguards deployment activities from pre-launch planning through post-launch stabilization, ensuring classifier systems are properly configured, tested, and scaled for each new model release</li>
<li>Coordinate complex cross-platform deployments - Manage classifier rollouts across platforms, each with distinct infrastructure constraints, capacity requirements, and deployment timelines</li>
<li>Make real-time technical trade-off decisions - Balance competing constraints around classifier capacity, latency impacts, false positive rates, and robustness requirements during fast-moving launch cycles with aggressive timelines</li>
<li>Drive capacity planning and performance optimization - Partner with Inference teams to model compute requirements, optimize classifier configurations (batch sizes, mesh topologies, chip allocation), and ensure we stay within overhead budgets while meeting safety requirements</li>
<li>Lead launch day war room coordination - Serve as primary safeguards point of contact during launches, coordinating monitoring, troubleshooting classifier issues, and driving go/no-go calls on deployment decisions</li>
<li>Build detailed execution plans and run-of-show - Create comprehensive launch checklists covering classifier configurations, monitoring thresholds, alerting setup, rollback procedures, and cross-team dependencies</li>
<li>Partner with product teams on co-launch coordination - Ensure new product surfaces have appropriate safeguards protections configured, tested, and deployed; whether launching independently or alongside new models</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As a Customer Activation Manager, you will be the architect of enterprise AI transformation—owning the critical first 90 days to ensure customers achieve breakthrough innovation rather than simply incremental improvement with Claude. You'll guide organizations from contract signature to production deployment across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and our API products, fundamentally changing how they work and compete.</p>
<p>This is a high-leverage role where you'll pioneer scalable activation methodologies that enable hundreds of enterprise customers to unlock transformative use cases and realize measurable business outcomes at unprecedented speed. You won't just follow playbooks—you'll design the frameworks and repeatable processes that can be deployed consistently across diverse customer environments.</p>
<p>You'll operate at the intersection of innovation strategy and hands-on execution. Your systems-thinking approach will directly shape how we activate enterprise customers, and your project management rigor will ensure every customer achieves meaningful outcomes within their first 90 days. By identifying patterns across customer activations, you'll build replicable approaches to organizational change while maintaining the agility to customize solutions for each customer's unique transformation journey.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own the complete 90-day activation journey</strong> from contract signature to production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional resources (Applied AI, Education, Support, Product) and customer teams to ensure rapid time-to-value across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and API products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design and scale activation frameworks</strong> by identifying patterns across customer deployments and building templated playbooks that balance standardization with customization for breakthrough outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive organizational transformation</strong> by developing change management strategies, rollout plans, and Train-the-Trainer programs that build internal AI champions and catalyze adoption across customer organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide technical guidance and enablement</strong> by developing deep product expertise to lead admin sessions, guide implementation decisions, and translate complex AI capabilities into business value for stakeholders at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage rigorous project delivery</strong> by creating detailed plans with clear milestones, conducting 30/60/90 day business reviews, proactively mitigating risks, and ensuring every activation meets success criteria within the 90-day window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define and track success metrics</strong> across activation rate, time-to-value, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency—using data to continuously optimize the activation motion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable seamless handoffs</strong> by documenting activation journeys and expansion opportunities, preparing Account Executives and (if applicable) Customer Success Managers for long-term customer innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Channel customer insights</strong> back to Product teams, serving as voice of the customer to influence roadmap and ensure Anthropic builds what drives transformative impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3+ years in customer-facing roles</strong> such as implementation management, technical account management, solutions consulting, or customer success—with a track record of managing multiple concurrent engagements while driving measurable outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems thinking and pattern recognition:</strong> You naturally ask "how might we scale this?" and have built repeatable processes, playbooks, or frameworks that work across different customer types—transforming 1:1 moments into scalable 1:many solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong project management and execution skills</strong> with ability to juggle concurrent customer activations, ruthlessly prioritize through a business impact lens, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical aptitude and AI enthusiasm:</strong> Ability to quickly master complex products, guide customers authoritatively on implementation decisions, and translate technical concepts into business value for audiences ranging from developers to C-suite executives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizational change and enablement experience</strong> including developing rollout strategies, navigating stakeholder resistance, building internal champions, and designing programs that drive adoption at scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comfortable building in ambiguity:</strong> This is a brand-new role—you'll thrive creating structure where none exists, adapting quickly as the business evolves, and learning continuously in a fast-paced environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-driven and metrics-oriented:</strong> Experience setting and tracking success metrics from day one, using data to optimize approaches, and demonstrating ROI to diverse stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth mindset with curiosity about AI's transformative potential</strong>—you're genuinely excited about how AI can fundamentally reshape work, workflows, and business models</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience with AI/ML products or developer tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background in change management, organizational transformation, or learning &amp; development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Familiarity with API integrations, SDK implementations, and developer workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience in consumption-based or usage-driven business models</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for desktop app engineers to join our Claude product team and help build native applications that harness the transformative power of advanced language models. Your mission will be to package our AI capabilities into elegant desktop experiences that put unprecedented capabilities at users' fingertips. You will work with a talented team of engineers, researchers, and product specialists to design and implement key components that bridge our AI technology with intuitive user interfaces. Join us in this exciting mission to transform how people engage with our AI technology and unlock new realms of human potential.</p>
<p>Today, our app is mostly web-based – but we’re eager to build the best possible version of Claude for macOS and Windows with a mix of both native and web technologies. You might be a great fit for this role if you’re up for the challenge of learning multiple programming languages.</p>
<p>We are more interested in strong engineers excited to learn new languages and technologies to build the best possible experience than we are looking for people with hands-on experience in Chromium, Electron, C++, or the various native macOS and Windows APIs. We believe that strong engineers can learn whatever technology is best suited to build the best possible experience – and we understand that even the best engineers will have little experience with one of the operating systems and areas we’d like to invest in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re looking for curious engineers excited to figure out, with us, what AI on the desktop could do.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop and maintain the core infrastructure and features within <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Claude.ai" target="_blank"><u>Claude.ai</u></a> and in our Electron-based desktop app using a typical web stack (TypeScript, React)</li>
<li>Use native code (Rust, Swift, C++) to bring advanced features to the desktop app, connecting Claude to macOS and Windows</li>
<li>Optimize application performance, memory usage, and startup time across platforms</li>
<li>Design and build robust update mechanisms and deployment pipelines</li>
<li>Create monitoring tools to track application performance and user experience</li>
<li>Build a strong intuition for how advanced LLMs could be most useful on your computer, augmenting humans in their work</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with strong emphasis on desktop application development</li>
<li>Have practical experience with Electron and deep understanding of its architecture</li>
<li>Possess strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and experience with modern frontend frameworks</li>
<li>Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use</li>
<li>Have experience with native module development in C++ to extend application capabilities</li>
<li>Understand macOS and/or Windows platform-specific technologies and development patterns</li>
<li>Have experience with cross-platform application packaging, code signing, and distribution</li>
<li>Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re working with a large number of technologies - and you might be an excellent candidate even if you’ve only worked with a subset of them. An ideal candidate may have never used Electron before but does have hands-on experience in working with Chromium’s C++. Similarly, a great candidate may have worked on Electron apps, but hasn’t used C++ or Swift before.</p>
<p>We understand that even the best engineers will have more experience with some platforms than others.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Strong candidates may also have experience with:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience working on and building operating systems, browsers, or deeply OS-integrated software (screensharing, video-calling, game engines, etc)</li>
<li>Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities</li>
<li>Demonstrated success implementing cross-platform development strategies</li>
<li>Vision for the future of AI-powered desktop applications and a drive to make that vision a reality</li>
<li>Have experience with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and security in desktop applications</li>
</ul>

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role:</h2>
<p>When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"</p>
<p>The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".</p>
<p>A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg" target="_blank">this introduction to Interpretability</a> from our research lead, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://colah.github.io/about.html" target="_blank">Chris Olah</a>; a <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU" target="_blank">discussion of our work</a> on the <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork" target="_blank">Hard Fork podcast</a> produced by the New York Times, and this <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability" target="_blank">blog post</a> (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team's notable publications include <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html" target="_blank">A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html" target="_blank">In-context Learning and Induction Heads</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html" target="_blank">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/" target="_blank">Scaling Monosemanticity</a>, and our Circuits’ <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html" target="_blank">Methods</a> and <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html" target="_blank">Biology</a> papers. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/" target="_blank">original circuits thread</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/" target="_blank">Multimodal Neurons</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/" target="_blank">Activation Atlases</a>, and <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/" target="_blank">Building Blocks</a>.</p>
<p>We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html" target="_blank">vision post</a>). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html" target="_blank">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html" target="_blank">Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent</a>, and our <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html" target="_blank">May 2023 update</a>), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model" target="_blank">work</a> found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.</p>
<p>We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/april-update/index.html#interpretability-architecture" target="_blank">Interpretability Architectures project</a> that involves collaborating with Pretraining.</p>

Some of our team's notable publications include <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html">A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html">In-context Learning and Induction Heads</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/">Scaling Monosemanticity</a>, and our Circuits’ <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html">Methods</a> and <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html">Biology</a> papers.

<p>We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html">vision post</a>). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html">Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent</a>, and our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html">May 2023 update</a>), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model">work</a> found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.</p>
<p>We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/april-update/index.html#interpretability-architecture">Interpretability Architectures project</a> that involves collaborating with Pretraining.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><p><em>Note: we don't have open Research Manager positions on the Interpretability team at this time.

If you're excited about interpretability research and open to an individual contributor role, we encourage you to apply.</em></p>
<h2><strong>About the Interpretability team:</strong></h2>
<p>When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"</p>
<p>The Interpretability team’s mission is to reverse engineer how trained models work, and Interpretability research is one of Anthropic’s core research bets on AI safety. We believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".</p>
<p>We aim to create a solid scientific foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html">vision post</a>). We have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html">Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent</a>, and our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html">May 2023 update</a>), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model">work</a> which found millions of features in Claude 3.0 Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html">most recent work</a>, we developed methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use these circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Claude Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p>
<h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>This is a critical leadership role responsible for building and scaling Anthropic's GSI and consulting partner ecosystem across the United Kingdom and Ireland. You will own the strategic partnerships with firms like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, Capgemini, EY, KPMG, and regional players across the UK market.</p>
<p><strong>This is a builder role, not a manager role.</strong> Given Anthropic's stage, we need someone who has proven they can take GSI partnerships from zero to scaled revenue engines — someone who has built these relationships from the ground up, not just inherited and managed existing ones.</p>
<p>You will treat each GSI as a structured sales pursuit with detailed stakeholder mapping, account plans, and targeted engagement strategies. You understand that there are two critical personas that drive partner success: the consultants who recommend tools on client projects, and the Key Account Directors (KADs) who control client access. You know how to engage both.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will bring deep existing relationships at VP+ level within target GSIs across the UK, understand how to drive meaningful KPIs (pipeline, revenue, consultants trained, KADs engaged, joint proposals), and obsess about competitive differentiation in the UK market.</p>
<h2><strong>In this role you will</strong></h2>

<li>Establish clear success metrics with each GSI and drive regular business reviews against targets</li>
<li>Create pipeline visibility and forecasting discipline for partner-sourced opportunities</li>
<li>Report on partnership health, progress, and commercial outcomes with data-driven insights</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Market Development &amp; Brand Building</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Amplify the Anthropic brand across the UK through strategic partner relationships</li>
<li>Develop and execute UK-specific GTM strategies adapted to local business practices and market dynamics</li>
<li>Navigate UK regulatory, compliance, and data sovereignty considerations including GDPR</li>
<li>Create competitive differentiation through unique partner capabilities and joint value propositions</li>
<li>Build Anthropic's reputation as the partner of choice in the UK market</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Enablement &amp; Scaling</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Deep existing relationships at VP+ level within target GSIs</strong> (Capgemini, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG, and regional players) across the UK market</li>
<li><strong>Experience driving and owning KPIs:</strong> partner-sourced pipeline and revenue, consultants trained and certified, Key Account Directors engaged, joint proposals submitted, partnership health metrics</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated ability to treat each GSI as a structured sales pursuit</strong> with detailed stakeholder mapping, account plans, and targeted engagement strategies for the personas that matter — consultants who recommend tools and KADs who control client access</li>
<li>Track record of driving hugely incremental revenues through GSI partnerships in the UK</li>
<li>Experience in enterprise technology partnerships, ideally within cloud, AI/ML, or platform businesses</li>
<li>Deep understanding of UK business practices, regulatory environment (including GDPR), and market dynamics</li>
<li>History of delivering exceptional customer success and brand protection through partner channels</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Builder mentality — comfortable starting from zero and creating scaled partnerships</li>
<li>Executive presence with credibility at VP+ and C-suite level within GSI organisations</li>
<li>Structured and disciplined approach to partnership development — treats GSIs as sales accounts</li>
<li>Deep understanding of GSI organisational dynamics, incentive structures, and decision-making processes</li>
<li>Ability to engage effectively with both consultant communities and Key Account Directors</li>
<li>Data-driven mindset with focus on measurable outcomes and KPI attainment</li>
<li>Strong understanding of UK business culture and professional services landscape</li>
<li>Commercial acumen with understanding of complex deal structures and partner economics</li>
<li>Competitive drive — obsessed with winning and creating differentiation</li>
<li>Collaborative approach with ability to work cross-functionally across sales, product, marketing, and regional teams</li>
<li>Willingness to travel across the NEU Regions as required</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role:</strong></h2>
<p>As a Support Operations Specialist focused on Anthropic’s Enterprise customers, you will be instrumental in pioneering an AI-native support model that serves our largest customers. This role blends program management, system design, and operational excellence to transform how we deliver Enterprise support at scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll own the strategic roadmap for Enterprise support operations, working at the intersection of AI capabilities, customer experience, and operational infrastructure. This means designing conversation flows that leverage AI capabilities, analyzing support data to identify automation opportunities, and managing cross-functional projects that scale our Enterprise support function.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Own quarterly roadmaps for enhancing AI support effectiveness with Enterprise use cases, prioritizing initiatives based on customer impact and data insights</li>
<li>Design and implement conversation flows that provide personalized support by leveraging integrations, Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections, and external data sources</li>
<li>Build intelligent triage logic and escalation rules that balance AI efficiency with human touch for complex cases</li>
<li>Analyze CSAT, resolution rates, and escalation patterns to identify opportunities for automation and improvement</li>
<li>Scope, design, and implement processes, tools, and systems specifically for Enterprise customer needs</li>
<li>Create monitoring dashboards and reporting mechanisms to track AI performance, and translate insights from customer interactions into actionable improvements</li>
<li>Partner with Product, Engineering, and GTM teams to integrate Enterprise feature launches into support workflows</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You might be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5+ years of experience in support operations, customer success operations, or similar roles (Enterprise/B2B customer exposure strongly preferred)</li>
<li>Possess strong program and project management skills with a track record of delivering complex, cross-functional initiatives</li>
<li>Have hands-on experience with ticketing systems (ideally Intercom), help centers, and support automation tools</li>
<li>Are genuinely excited about AI and see the potential for it to enhance (not replace) human expertise in customer support</li>
<li>Have deep empathy for customer pain points and consistently prioritize user experience in operational decisions</li>
<li>Combine analytical rigor with creative problem-solving—you're equally comfortable analyzing CSAT data and designing conversational flows</li>
<li>Think in systems: you naturally see how processes, tools, and people interconnect and can design solutions holistically</li>
<li>Build strong cross-functional partnerships and can influence outcomes across Engineering, Product, and Go-to-Market teams</li>
<li>Thrive in ambiguous environments and can create structure and process where none exists</li>
<li>Have excellent written communication skills and can translate complex technical concepts into clear documentation</li>
<li>Are adaptable and energized by learning quickly in a fast-moving environment</li>
</ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<p>As a Portfolio Activation Manager on Anthropic's Private Equity team, you'll build and scale programs that drive AI adoption across private equity portfolio companies. Working closely with Tier 1 PE firms, you'll design and execute scaled enablement programs—webinar series, onboarding cohorts, and hands-on workshops—that activate hundreds of portfolio companies with minimal human touch time.</p>
<p>You'll partner with Value Creation and Operating Partner teams at PE firms to understand portfolio needs, then build automated, repeatable programs that drive bottom-up adoption of Claude products (Claude for Work, Claude Code, and API). This isn't a 1:1 customer success role—it's about designing systems and infrastructure that scale across entire portfolios, turning initial interest into active customers and engaged users.</p>
<p>This is a new role and function at Anthropic. You'll take the foundation that our Commercial and PE GTM leaders have built and turn it into a repeatable playbook. You should be passionate about building at the intersection of program design, automation, and executive stakeholder management.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and execute scaled activation programs (webinars, onboarding cohorts, office hours, executive events) that reach hundreds of portfolio companies across multiple PE firms</li>
<li>Develop portfolio-specific commercial strategies including preferred pricing models, contract terms, and growth initiatives aligned with PE firm objectives</li>
<li>Own portfolio activation metrics including new customer acquisition, ARR growth, and product engagement across Claude for Work, Claude Code, and API</li>
<li>Manage relationships with PE firm Operating Partners and Value Creation teams, delivering monthly business reviews and quarterly adoption reports</li>
<li>Create enablement content, documentation, and training to help portfolio companies effectively utilize Claude products, and enable Account Executives to navigate PE portfolio dynamics</li>
<li>Gather product feedback from portfolio companies and represent their needs to inform Anthropic's product roadmap and PE-specific features</li>
<li>Plan and execute portfolio-focused events, campaigns, and promotions including on-site executive summits and virtual programming</li>
<li>Coordinate with Account Executives to route qualified leads from portfolio companies and ensure smooth handoffs</li>
<li>Track and report on key metrics to measure the success and ROI of portfolio activation initiatives</li>
<li>Continuously refine programs based on data, feedback, and portfolio company outcomes, building a repeatable playbook that scales across firms</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5-7 years of experience in B2B SaaS program management, partnerships, sales enablement, revenue operations, or customer education with a proven track record of building scaled programs</li>
<li>Possess strong automation skills and systems thinking—you're comfortable building workflows and infrastructure that eliminate manual work</li>
<li>Have experience presenting to and managing relationships with senior executives (VP+ level), translating technical concepts into business value</li>
<li>Demonstrate a track record of moving fast in ambiguous environments and launching programs quickly with imperfect information</li>
<li>Are comfortable working with technical products and developer tools—you don't need to code, but you should understand AI concepts well enough to explain them clearly</li>
<li>Show self-sufficiency and resourcefulness—you can pull together content, coordinate across teams, and execute without constant oversight</li>
<li>Possess analytical orientation toward metrics and a bias toward measuring what matters (pipeline, revenue, adoption) vs. vanity metrics</li>
<li>Have exceptional communication and relationship-building skills with both technical and business audiences</li>
<li>Can thrive in a fast-paced environment and adapt to changing priorities</li>
<li>Are passionate about the positive impact that AI can have for businesses and society as a whole</li>

<li>Be a champion for Anthropic’s mission in the field.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You Have:</strong></h2>

<li>Production experience with LLMs including advanced prompt engineering, agent development, evaluation frameworks, and deployment at scale.</li>
<li>Strong programming skills with proficiency in Python (and ideally in one or more additional languages like Typescript, Java, etc) and experience shipping production applications&nbsp;</li>
<li>High agency with an ability to navigate ambiguity present in complex organizations.</li>
<li>High cooperation mindset for cross-organizational collaboration, balancing competing priorities with integrity.</li>
<li>Passion for advancing safe, beneficial AI systems through creative technical applications.</li>
<li>Strong communication skills to conduct discovery with customers and to convey technical concepts to diverse stakeholders while maintaining a low ego and collaborative approach.</li>

<p>In just a few months since launch, Claude Code has already redefined how developers interact with AI. Yet we are only scratching the surface. As model intelligence accelerates, the ultimate form factor of agentic software development remains unwritten. We seek a product manager who combines deep technical understanding, genuine love for developers, and strong product intuition. You should be equally comfortable discussing customer feedback with world-class researchers, debugging user workflows with engineers, and presenting product strategy to executives.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define the roadmap for an area of the Claude Code product suite</li>
<li>Translate cutting-edge AI advances into practical developer features</li>
<li>Build an ecosystem around the CLI and other products so that developers can easily share best practices</li>
</ul>
<h2>You might be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a combined 5+ years in product management and engineering, including at least 1 year as a professional engineer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have a deep technical background with experience working cross-functionally with engineering teams to ship technical products.</li>
<li>Track record of launching ambitious products that have achieved distribution or commercial success. Experience in dev tools is preferred.</li>
<li>Stay up-to-date and hands-on with AI coding tools, model capabilities, and industry trends</li>
<li>Have a creative, hacker spirit and love solving puzzles</li>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Cross-functional Prompt Engineer at Anthropic, you'll own and shape Claude's behaviors across all of our products, ensuring users get a consistent, safe, and beneficial experience whether they're using claude.ai, Claude Code, or our other offerings. This role sits at the intersection of research and product, combining rigorous prompt engineering with strategic thinking about model behaviors.</p>

You'll also serve as a trusted resource for product teams tackling difficult prompting challenges, bringing rigor to our production prompts and scaling best practices across the organization.</p>
<p>This role requires someone who can balance immediate product needs with long-term behavioral goals, and who cares deeply about making Claude a healthy alternative in the AI landscape. You'll need strong prompting skills, technical foundations, excellent judgment about model behaviors, and the collaborative skills to work across research, product, and safety teams. This role offers a unique opportunity to directly shape how Claude behaves across all of Anthropic's products, ensuring our AI systems are safe, beneficial, and aligned with human values at scale.</p>
<p><em>Note: We are open to exceptional prompters who are less comfortable with (but open to learning) coding, and adjusting expectations accordingly. However, we still require basic Python familiarity and an ability to navigate unfamiliar codebases.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Author and maintain behavior system prompts for each new Claude model release, ensuring consistent and aligned behaviors across products</li>
<li>Deliver meta-prompts for critical research synthetic data pipelines, enabling our alignment and training efforts</li>
<li>Review production prompt changes from product teams and serve as a resource for particularly challenging prompting problems involving alignment and reputational risks</li>
<li>Identify, triage, and prioritize behavioral issues across Claude products, leading incident response for behavioral and policy concerns</li>
<li>Develop behavioral evaluations in collaboration with product teams and alignment research to measure and track Claude's behaviors</li>
<li>Define and streamline processes for rolling out prompt changes, including launch criteria and review practices</li>
<li>Create model-specific prompt guides that document quirks and optimal prompting strategies for each release</li>
<li>Contribute to product evaluations and prompt infrastructure improvements</li>
<li>Track how Claude's behaviors compare to competitors, particularly on safety dimensions</li>
<li>Scale prompting best practices and define success metrics for production behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have extensive prompt engineering experience with large language models, including writing and evaluating complex multi-step prompts</li>
<li>Possess deep knowledge of Claude's behaviors, capabilities, and limitations, with strong intuition for what issues are promptable versus requiring model-layer changes</li>
<li>Can write Python and create behavioral evaluations from scratch</li>
<li>Have excellent judgment about what model behaviors should look like in response to various inputs</li>
<li>Demonstrate strong technical understanding, including comprehension of agent scaffold architectures and model training processes</li>
<li>Excel at working across organizational boundaries, collaborating effectively with research, product, and safety teams</li>
<li>Have core product management skills: prioritization, requirements gathering, stakeholder management, and translating user feedback into actionable specifications</li>
<li>Can independently drive changes through production systems with strong execution and responsiveness</li>
<li>Care deeply about AI safety and model welfare, understanding the ethical implications of model behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Background in philosophy, ethics, or psychology that informs thinking about model behaviors and values</li>
<li>Experience with RLHF, constitutional AI, or other alignment techniques</li>
<li>Track record of writing specifications or guidelines that shape complex system behaviors</li>
<li>Experience responding to safety incidents or behavioral issues in production AI systems</li>
<li>Formal training in ethics or moral philosophy</li>
<li>Published work or demonstrated expertise in AI safety or alignment</li>
<li>Experience building and maintaining evaluation frameworks for language models</li>
<li>Background in data science with emphasis on data quality and verification</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<li><strong>Build program structure for emerging security domains </strong>– Create program charters, establish roles and timelines, develop communication strategies, and define success metrics for nascent security initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Partner with third-party partners </strong>– Manage security aspects of infrastructure partnerships, including contract requirements, relationship management, and security assurance processes</li>
<li><strong>Lead stakeholder communication and executive reporting </strong>– Prepare regular status updates, deliver company-wide communications, lead program reviews, and ensure leadership has visibility into critical security milestones, blockers, and risks</li>

<ul>
<li>Have experience driving cross-functional projects, building longer-running programs, and interfacing with technical and non-technical stakeholders.</li>
<li>Have experience executing technical programs that require systems and engineering-level knowledge.</li>
<li>Have a deep interest in and/or a willingness to learn about cybersecurity or regulatory compliance.</li>
<li>Have experience leveraging LLMs to automate workflows, improve operational efficiency, and develop novel solutions for complex technical and organizational challenges.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have experience reporting on complex programs through data-driven benchmarks, including writing SQL queries.</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>This is a high-impact role requiring deep experience deploying technical tools at enterprise scale.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define and track enterprise success metrics </strong>across activation rate, time-to-value, departmental adoption curves, executive satisfaction, and business impact – using data to optimize the large-scale activation motion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop scalable enterprise playbooks </strong>by codifying learnings from complex deployments into repeatable frameworks that can be leveraged across similar large-scale engagements and inform potential Professional Services offerings</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<p><strong>Drive cross-functional execution:</strong> Collaborate with Sales, Product, Marketing, Finance and Legal teams to drive cross-deal insights, set strategies, and structure deals with complex technical, commercial, and go-to-market components</p>

<h2 class="heading">You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>8+ years of experience in strategic business development, strategic partnerships, corporate development, or strategic commercial roles at enterprise technology companies</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Deep understanding of enterprise SaaS business models, platform economics, and B2B technology ecosystems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience directly leading negotiations on complex, multi-stakeholder deals with senior executives, including structuring terms that balance competitive dynamics with mutual value creation</p>
</li>

<p>Strong strategic thinking capabilities with the ability to navigate significant ambiguity, identify and capitalize on transformational opportunities, and execute in fast-moving environments</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h3 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h3>
<p>At Anthropic, we're building AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and transformative. Our mission is to develop AI that benefits humanity, and we believe the most powerful capabilities emerge when we thoughtfully bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and real-world applications.</p>
<p>Anthropic Labs serves as our internal accelerator. We're looking for the next breakout hits that bring substantial revenue or transform an industry. We operate in close partnership with research and build through fast iteration cycles. Past successes include Claude Code and MCP.</p>
<p>We're seeking versatile, entrepreneurial engineers to join Labs. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of cutting-edge research and real-world application, rapidly building and testing new experiences, working directly with researchers and users, and generating the insights that shape Anthropic's product future. You'll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, willing to kill your own projects when the data says to, and energized by the pace of building in uncharted territory.</p>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rapidly prototype full-stack applications that showcase emerging AI capabilities, shipping early and often to maximize learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate closely with research teams to understand new model capabilities and translate them into intuitive user experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work directly with internal test users and external partners to gather feedback, iterate quickly, and validate (or invalidate) product concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and run structured experiments to test hypotheses, balancing creative exploration with rigorous evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate documentation and insights to guide successful prototypes toward full product teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocate for user experience and product considerations early in the research process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide feedback to research teams about model effectiveness and where capabilities can be improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexibly contribute across Labs initiatives based on organizational priorities and emerging opportunities—context from one project should inform the next</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 8+ years of experience building full-stack applications, with a track record of zero-to-one work in startup or startup-like environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrive in ambiguity and are energized (not anxious) by uncertainty—you're comfortable working on projects that might not exist in three months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a hacker mentality: high agency, bias toward shipping, comfort with technical debt when it's the right tradeoff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are deeply user-centric—you validate ideas with actual users before over-investing and talk about problems before solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can articulate learnings from failed or killed projects without defensiveness; you treat your work as experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold strong opinions loosely—you advocate forcefully for ideas but change your mind based on evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are a generalist who can transition between different problem spaces as priorities shift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work independently with good judgment about what matters, without needing constant direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have strong technical skills across modern web development stacks (React, Node.js, Python, etc.) and are comfortable with APIs, databases, and cloud technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate effectively and translate complex AI capabilities into intuitive experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>Strong candidates may also have</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience building products that involve AI/ML components or working with large language models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience collaborating directly with research teams in AI/ML environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background conducting user research, interviews, and usability testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience across both B2B and B2C product development, or in multiple industries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design sensibility or hands-on experience with UI/UX for AI-powered applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with real-time applications, WebSocket implementations, or complex frontend interactions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>What we're not looking for at this stage</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deep specialists who can't adapt if their domain becomes irrelevant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineers who've only succeeded in big-company structures with well-defined processes and long timelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are precious about their work or frame all past projects as successes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who need clear roadmaps and get stressed by shifting priorities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>Candidates need not have</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>100% of the skills listed above</p>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>In this role on the Applied AI team, you will lead the delivery of transformational AI solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll own high-value engagements where we collaborate directly with customers to build tailored AI agents for their most critical business processes.</p>
<p>You will own end-to-end delivery from signed SOW through production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional teams including Engineering, Product, Design, and customer stakeholders. This is not project management—you'll navigate complex enterprise environments, remove technical and organizational blockers, and ensure we deliver measurable business outcomes while maintaining our high standards for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>You'll work hand-in-hand with Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) who handle core technical delivery, while you own stakeholder management, delivery cadence, and organizational complexity.</p>
<p>You'll champion our mission in the field while building the playbooks and processes that enable us to scale this emerging motion.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) alongside engineers, structuring engagements with clear scope, milestones, and success criteria.</li>
<li>Participate in technical discovery sessions to understand customer requirements and inform engagement design.</li>
<li>Own AI product building end-to-end: maintain and adjust roadmaps as scope evolves, identify and work through blockers, and help the team navigate delivery challenges.</li>
<li>Drive engagement delivery from SOW signature through production deployment, ensuring milestones are met, blockers are removed, and stakeholders are aligned.</li>
<li>Partner closely with FDEs: manage organizational complexity and facilitate their access to customer stakeholders and systems.</li>
<li>Orchestrate cross-functional teams: coordinate Engineering, Product/Design resources, and customer teams to deliver integrated solutions on time and within scope.</li>
<li>Manage stakeholder relationships: maintain regular cadence with customer executive sponsors, technical leads, and procurement while surfacing issues and celebrating wins.</li>
<li>Lead delivery operations: run sprint ceremonies, milestone reviews, and progress reporting; translate technical complexity into executive-level updates.</li>
<li>Navigate enterprise complexity: work through security reviews, legal approvals, procurement processes, and organizational dynamics that can block progress.</li>
<li>Manage scope and change: handle scope changes, set expectations, and negotiate contract modifications when needed.</li>
<li>Identify risks early and develop mitigation strategies; know when to escalate to leadership and provide clear context when doing so.</li>
<li>Serve as the first line of escalation for FDEs and customer stakeholders; resolve conflicts before they impact delivery.</li>
<li>Document engagement patterns, create repeatable frameworks, and contribute to the operational infrastructure that enables growth.</li>
<li>Travel as needed to customer sites to build relationships, unblock issues, and demonstrate Anthropic's commitment (25-50% travel expected).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You Have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>5+ years of experience in technical program management, engagement management, or delivery leadership in professional services, consulting, or enterprise software.</li>
<li>Track record delivering complex technical projects for Fortune 500 clients, ideally large-scale engagements with multiple workstreams.</li>
<li>Strong technical acumen with ability to understand AI/ML concepts, software architecture, and enterprise systems (you don't need to code, but must be able to translate between technical and business stakeholders).</li>
<li>Executive presence with ability to present to C-suite sponsors and navigate enterprise organizational dynamics.</li>
<li>High agency with demonstrated ability to remove blockers, make decisions with incomplete information, and drive progress through ambiguity.</li>
<li>Exceptional communication skills for managing diverse stakeholders, running effective meetings, and producing clear status reporting.</li>
<li>Process design mindset with ability to create structure where none exists while remaining flexible to emerging patterns.</li>
<li>High cooperation orientation for balancing competing priorities across customer needs, engineering capacity, and product strategy.</li>
<li>Minimum Bachelors Degree in Computer Science or related field.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Plus:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience in financial services, healthcare/life sciences, or pharma verticals.</li>
<li>Background at a Forward Deployed Engineering company or Big 3 / Big 4 professional services and consulting firms.</li>
<li>Exceptional understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations.</li>
<li>Experience with regulated industries and compliance requirements.</li>
<li>Experience managing delivery teams with embedded engineers at customer sites.</li>
<li>Familiarity with agile/scrum methodologies in client-facing delivery contexts.</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Technical Program Manager for model evaluations, you'll own end-to-end coordination of our evaluation ecosystem— building a feedback loop from shaping eval strategy during early model development through launch execution. You'll be the critical bridge between Research, Product, Marketing, and Engineering teams.</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of frontier AI research and product launches. Evals are an important part of how we measure whether our models meet the bar—for capability, safety, and competitive positioning. Beyond launch coordination, you'll help scale our evals ecosystem: from early-stage model evals for RL environments, to the systems and infrastructure on which evals run, to tooling that enables the whole pipeline. A strong TPM in this space can immediately reduce chaos during launches while also driving systemic improvements that compound over time.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Launch Coordination</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Standardize how evaluation results are generated, documented, compared across model versions, and communicated to stakeholders</li>
<li>Own end-to-end eval readiness for model launches—tracking which evals are ready, which need scores on past models, and which meet the bar for marketing materials</li>
<li>Establish and enforce clear criteria for eval inclusion: scores on historical models, state-of-the-art performance, and competitor comparisons</li>
<li>Coordinate between research teams, marketing, and product to consolidate eval status into a single source of truth</li>
<li>Maintain a high bar: ensure reported statistics reflect model capabilities in an honest, accurate, and transparent way</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Get involved early in model development cycles, helping shape eval plans for RL environments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Partner with research and infrastructure teams to improve underlying evals infrastructure—eval-syncer reliability, results storage and querying, automation capabilities</li>
<li>Drive prioritization of eval tooling enhancements based on researcher needs</li>
<li>Identify patterns across launches and drive systemic fixes rather than point solutions</li>
<li>Work with PMs and researchers to improve and implement high priority evals launches</li>
<li>Maintain and prioritize the eval roadmap—working with cross-functional teams to identify which new evals are needed for upcoming launches and product requirements</li>
<li>Implement an operating model that reflects an evals environment with increasing complexity&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>Process &amp; Systems</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Build lightweight but rigorous tracking systems—moving key information into structured formats that enable better decision-making</li>
<li>Create eval dashboards that provide real-time visibility into training progress on hero evals, enabling earlier intervention when scores look concerning</li>
<li>Document eval processes, requirements, and lessons learned to build institutional knowledge</li>
<li>Coordinate compute allocation for large-scale evals with infrastructure teams</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5+ years of technical program management experience with a track record of bringing order to chaotic, high-stakes coordination problems</li>
<li>Possess scientific depth and a very high quality bar for data</li>
<li>Have experience with ML/AI evaluation methodologies, benchmarking, or research quality assurance</li>
<li>Have a background in research operations, scientific publishing, or data quality management</li>
<li>Have previous experience as data analyst, data scientist, or software engineer</li>
<li>Can build trust with research teams by understanding their work deeply enough to add value beyond coordination</li>
<li>Are skilled at cross-functional coordination involving research, product, marketing, and engineering—navigating competing priorities and driving alignment</li>
<li>Have working familiarity with data analysis tools (SQL, Python, or similar) for querying eval results and building dashboards</li>
<li>Have familiarity with LLM capabilities and limitations and experience working with AI research teams</li>
<li>Excel at written and verbal communication, translating technical nuance for marketing stakeholders while maintaining precision</li>
<li>Thrive in unstructured environments with a bias toward action and a knack for creating clarity in ambiguous situations</li>
<li>Have extremely high ownership and attention to detail</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As a Customer Activation Manager, you will be the architect of enterprise AI transformation—owning the critical first 90 days to ensure customers achieve breakthrough innovation rather than simply incremental improvement with Claude. You'll guide organizations from contract signature to production deployment across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and our API products, fundamentally changing how they work and compete.</p>
<p>This is a high-leverage role where you'll pioneer scalable activation methodologies that enable hundreds of enterprise customers to unlock transformative use cases and realize measurable business outcomes at unprecedented speed. You won't just follow playbooks—you'll design the frameworks and repeatable processes that can be deployed consistently across diverse customer environments.</p>
<p>You'll operate at the intersection of innovation strategy and hands-on execution. Your systems-thinking approach will directly shape how we activate enterprise customers, and your project management rigor will ensure every customer achieves meaningful outcomes within their first 90 days. By identifying patterns across customer activations, you'll build replicable approaches to organizational change while maintaining the agility to customize solutions for each customer's unique transformation journey.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own the complete 90-day activation journey</strong> from contract signature to production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional resources (Applied AI, Education, Support, Product) and customer teams to ensure rapid time-to-value across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and API products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design and scale activation frameworks</strong> by identifying patterns across customer deployments and building templated playbooks that balance standardization with customization for breakthrough outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive organizational transformation</strong> by developing change management strategies, rollout plans, and Train-the-Trainer programs that build internal AI champions and catalyze adoption across customer organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide technical guidance and enablement</strong> by developing deep product expertise to lead admin sessions, guide implementation decisions, and translate complex AI capabilities into business value for stakeholders at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage rigorous project delivery</strong> by creating detailed plans with clear milestones, conducting 30/60/90 day business reviews, proactively mitigating risks, and ensuring every activation meets success criteria within the 90-day window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define and track success metrics</strong> across activation rate, time-to-value, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency—using data to continuously optimize the activation motion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable seamless handoffs</strong> by documenting activation journeys and expansion opportunities, preparing Account Executives and (if applicable) Customer Success Managers for long-term customer innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Channel customer insights</strong> back to Product teams, serving as voice of the customer to influence roadmap and ensure Anthropic builds what drives transformative impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3+ years in customer-facing roles</strong> such as implementation management, technical account management, solutions consulting, or customer success—with a track record of managing multiple concurrent engagements while driving measurable outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems thinking and pattern recognition:</strong> You naturally ask "how might we scale this?" and have built repeatable processes, playbooks, or frameworks that work across different customer types—transforming 1:1 moments into scalable 1:many solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong project management and execution skills</strong> with ability to juggle concurrent customer activations, ruthlessly prioritize through a business impact lens, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical aptitude and AI enthusiasm:</strong> Ability to quickly master complex products, guide customers authoritatively on implementation decisions, and translate technical concepts into business value for audiences ranging from developers to C-suite executives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizational change and enablement experience</strong> including developing rollout strategies, navigating stakeholder resistance, building internal champions, and designing programs that drive adoption at scale</p>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Are motivated by reducing catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems</li>
<li>Are excited to transition into full-time empirical AI safety research and would be interested in a full-time role at Anthropic</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><strong>Please note:</strong> We do not guarantee that we will make any full-time offers to fellows. However, strong performance during the program may indicate that a Fellow would be a good fit here at Anthropic. In previous cohorts, over 40% of fellows received a full-time offer, and we’ve supported many more to go on to do great work on safety at other organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a strong technical background in computer science, mathematics, physics, cybersecurity, or related fields</li>
<li>Thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments</li>
<li>Can implement ideas quickly and communicate clearly</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience with empirical ML research projects</li>
<li>Experience working with Large Language Models</li>
<li>Experience in one of the research areas mentioned above</li>
<li>Experience with deep learning frameworks and experiment management</li>
<li>Track record of open-source contributions</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Candidates must be:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fluent in Python programming</li>
<li>Available to work full-time on the Fellows program for 4 months</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Interview process</strong></span></h1>
<p>The interview process will include an initial application &amp; references check, technical assessments &amp; interviews, and a research discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Compensation</span></strong></h1>
<p>The expected base stipend for this role is 3,850 USD / 2,310 GBP / 4,300 CAD per week, with an expectation of 40 hours per week, for 4 months (with possible extension).</p>
<h1><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Logistics</span></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Logistics Requirements: </strong>To participate in the Fellows program, you must have work authorization in the US, UK, or Canada and be located in that country during the program.</p>
<p><strong>Workspace Locations:</strong> We have designated shared workspaces in London and Berkeley where fellows will work from and mentors will visit. <strong>We are also open to remote fellows in the UK, US, or Canada</strong>. We will ask you about your availability to work from Berkeley or London (full- or part-time) during the program.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Sponsorship: </strong>We are <strong>not</strong> currently able to sponsor visas for fellows. To participate in the Fellows program, you need to have or independently obtain full-time work authorization in the UK, the US, or Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications and interviews are managed by <a class="c-link" href="https://www.constellation.org/" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://www.constellation.org/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Constellation</a>, our official recruiting partner for this program.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>Come work with us!</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. <strong data-stringify-type="bold">Guidance on Candidates' AI Usage:</strong>&nbsp;Learn about&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" data-sk="tooltip_parent">our policy</a>&nbsp;for using AI in our application process</p></div>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>You will deeply understand the research workflows of our Finetuning teams and automate the high-friction parts – turning days of manual experimentation into hours. You’ll build the tools and infrastructure that enable researchers across the organization to develop, evaluate, and optimize reward signals for training our models. Your scalable platforms will make it easy to experiment with different reward methodologies, assess their robustness, and iterate rapidly on improvements to help the rest of Anthropic train our reward models.</p>
<p>This is a role for someone who wants to stay close to the science while having outsized leverage. You'll partner directly with researchers on the Rewards team and across the broader Fine-Tuning organization to understand what slows them down: running human data experiments before adding to preference models, debugging reward hacks, comparing rubric methodologies across domains. Then you'll build the systems that make those workflows 10x faster. When you have bandwidth, you'll contribute directly to research projects yourself. Your work will directly impact our ability to scale reward development across domains, from crafting and evaluating rubrics to understanding the effects of human feedback data to detecting and mitigating reward hacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking for someone who combines strong engineering fundamentals with research experience – someone who can scope ambiguous problems, ship quickly, and cares as much about the science as the systems.</p>
<p><em>Note: For this role, we conduct all interviews in Python.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and build infrastructure that enables researchers to rapidly iterate on reward signals, including tools for rubric development, human feedback data analysis, and reward robustness evaluation</li>
<li>Develop systems for automated quality assessment of rewards, including detection of reward hacks and other pathologies</li>
<li>Create tooling that allows researchers to easily compare different reward methodologies (preference models, rubrics, programmatic rewards) and understand their effects</li>
<li>Build pipelines and workflows that reduce toil in reward development, from dataset preparation to evaluation to deployment</li>
<li>Implement monitoring and observability systems to track reward signal quality and surface issues during training runs</li>
<li>Collaborate with researchers to translate science requirements into platform capabilities</li>
<li>Optimize existing systems for performance, reliability, and ease of use</li>
<li>Contribute to the development of best practices and documentation for reward development workflows</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have prior research experience&nbsp;</li>
<li>Are excited to work closely with researchers and translate ambiguous requirements into well-scoped engineering projects</li>
<li>Have strong Python skills</li>
<li>Have experience with ML workflows and data pipelines, and building related infrastructure/tooling/platforms</li>
<li>Are comfortable working across the stack, ranging from data pipelines to experiment tracking to user-facing tooling</li>
<li>Can balance building robust, maintainable systems with the need to move quickly in a research environment</li>
<li>Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact</li>
<li>Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts of your work and are motivated by Anthropic's mission to develop safe AI</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have experience with</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience with ML research</li>
<li>Building internal tooling and platforms for ML researchers</li>
<li>Data quality assessment and pipeline optimization</li>
<li>Experiment tracking, evaluation frameworks, or MLOps tooling</li>
<li>Large-scale data processing (e.g., Spark, Hive, or similar)</li>
<li>Kubernetes, distributed systems, or cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Familiarity with reinforcement learning or fine-tuning workflows&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Representative projects</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Building infrastructure that allows researchers to rapidly test new rubric designs against small models before scaling up</li>
<li>Developing automated systems to detect reward hacks and surface problematic behaviors during training</li>
<li>Creating tooling for comparing different grading methodologies and understanding their effects on model behavior</li>
<li>Building a data quality flywheel that helps researchers identify problematic transcripts and feed improvements back into the system</li>
<li>Developing dashboards and monitoring systems that give researchers visibility into reward signal quality across training runs</li>
<li>Streamlining dataset preparation workflows to reduce latency and operational overhead</li>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>In the Product Designer, Claude Code role, you'll:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design for agentic workflows across surfaces.</strong> Own the experience of Claude Code across terminal, IDE extensions, web, and Slack. Design how Claude communicates progress, requests permissions, handles failures, and coordinates multi-step autonomous work.</li>
<li><strong>Invent new interaction patterns.</strong> Claude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated—a power tool for sophisticated users. Design conventions that respect developer expertise while making complex agentic behaviors feel intuitive and trustworthy.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype in code.</strong> This is a developer tool. You'll work directly with terminal interfaces, understand CLI constraints, and build functional prototypes. The best ideas will come from hands-on exploration, not just mockups.</li>
<li><strong>Ship fast and iterate.</strong> Claude Code moves quickly—new capabilities ship constantly as models improve. You'll need to design, test, and refine in tight cycles, often on critical-path work for major launches.</li>
<li><strong>Work fluidly across the team.</strong> Partner with engineering, research, and product without needing clear handoffs or defined lanes. Jump into problems wherever you're useful—whether that's pairing with an engineer on implementation details, exploring a new model capability with a researcher, or pressure-testing an idea with users directly.</li>
<li><strong>Raise the bar on craft.</strong> Obsess over the details that make power tools feel right: information density, speed, keyboard-first interaction, clear feedback loops, minimal friction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Why this role matters:</strong></h2>
<p>Claude Code started as a research project and became one of Anthropic's most successful products, generating over $1B in annualized revenue within six months of launch. It redefined how developers work, and we're just getting started.</p>
<p>This is genuinely new territory. We're designing the <em>future of coding </em>— Claude working autonomously on tasks, making decisions, asking for input when needed, and coordinating with humans throughout. The interaction patterns for this don't exist yet. We need to invent them.</p>
<p>The product is expanding fast: from terminal to VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, to web, to Slack. Each surface brings new design challenges. And the underlying models keep getting more capable, which means the design problems keep evolving. We need designers who can move as fast as the technology—people who are excited by the ambiguity, not frustrated by it.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You might be a great fit if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>You live at the intersection of code and design</strong>. You genuinely enjoy developer tools and tinker with new things for fun. This role will shape how developers experience agentic coding—not just at Anthropic, but across the industry..</li>
<li><strong>You're a tinkerer and explorer.</strong> You try new tools before anyone asks you to. You have opinions about terminal emulators and keyboard shortcuts. You're energized by where AI is headed—and want to be part of figuring out what comes next.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Bonus points:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience designing for command-line interfaces, IDEs or other dev tools</li>
<li>Contributions to open source projects or developer tools</li>
<li>Understanding of how LLMs work and their current capabilities/limitations</li>
<li>A GitHub profile, personal site, or side projects that show what you build when no one's asking</li>
</ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

<p>As the primary marketing counterpart to the EMEA Industries GTM Leaders, you will develop the go-to-market strategy for enterprise verticals in the region.

<li>Partner with Solutions, Field Marketing, Campaigns, Comms, and Growth Marketing to deliver integrated programs; collaborate with global counterparts to share insights and scale what works</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Key Objectives:</strong></h2>

<li>Building the EMEA Industries marketing function from scratch—defining account tiering criteria, campaign architecture, and sales partnership rhythms for a new region</li>

<li>Have experience at both a fast-paced startup/scale-up AND a large tech company (understands enterprise selling)</li>
<li>Possess hands-on content creation skills—can jump into a deck and create compelling slides, email copy, and sales enablement materials with minimal guidance</li>
<li>Have deep expertise in account intelligence tools like 6sense or Demandbase</li>
<li>Have experience marketing into major enterprise accounts (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC, Barclays, AstraZeneca, GSK scale companies)</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<p>This is a net-new team, initially seeded with a small number of tenured Claude.ai engineers. Historically, the design, development, and maintenance of our systems and infrastructure was a shared responsibility between our small group of Claude Experiences engineers, collaborating closely with our larger Platform and Infra organizations. We believe that there is an opportunity for a team to drive a lot of impact, both in our foundations and in the product, by focusing on backend systems specifically for Claude.ai.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Demonstrate strong interpersonal skills and ability to guide teams through rapidly evolving organization priorities while building underlying stable platforms</li>
<li>Have excellent cross-functional leadership skills to build alignment between research, engineering and product</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><p><strong><em>Please apply by January 12, 2026 <a href="https://constellation.fillout.com/anthropicsecurityfellows">using this link</a></em></strong></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>AI Security at Anthropic</strong></span></h1>
<p>We believe we are at an inflection point for AI’s impact on cybersecurity. Models are now useful for cybersecurity tasks in practice: for example, Claude can now <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/cyber-competitions/">outperform human teams</a> in some cybersecurity competitions and help us discover <a href="https://claude.com/blog/automate-security-reviews-with-claude-code">vulnerabilities in our own code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking for researchers and engineers to help us accelerate defensive use of AI to secure code and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Anthropic Fellows Program Overview</strong></span></h1>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is seeking an engineering leader to lead the teams responsible for building all consumer-facing Claude experiences—including web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions. In this role, you'll shape how millions of users interact with Claude daily, driving the technical vision and execution for interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and push the boundaries of what AI-powered applications can be.</p>
<p>This is a highly technical leadership role. While you'll be responsible for building and guiding engineering teams, you'll remain deeply hands-on— steering architectural decisions and staying close to the work. You'll partner closely with Product, Design, Research, and Go-to-Market teams to not only build what's on the roadmap, but to anticipate where the product needs to go next. We're looking for someone who can see around corners and help us skate to where the puck is going.</p>
<p>We're building at an extraordinary pace in a rapidly evolving space. You should thrive in environments where priorities shift quickly, where you're expected to ship fast without sacrificing quality, and where the problems you're solving don't have established playbooks.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lead and grow the UI engineering teams responsible for Claude's consumer products across web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, and browser extensions</li>
<li>Define the technical vision and architecture for our frontend systems, ensuring they scale with our rapidly growing user base</li>
<li>Stay deeply technical—participate in design reviews and architectural decisions while maintaining a broad view of the product</li>
<li>Partner closely with Product and Design to shape product direction, bringing an informed point of view on what we should build and how users will experience it</li>
<li>Drive engineering excellence through best practices in performance, accessibility, and cross-platform consistency</li>
<li>Build and mentor a world-class team of frontend engineers, creating an environment where people do the best work of their careers</li>
<li>Collaborate across functions—including Research, Trust &amp; Safety, and Go-to-Market—to ensure our products meet the needs of users and the business</li>
<li>Navigate ambiguity and make sound decisions quickly in a fast-moving environment</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 10+ years of experience building consumer-facing web and mobile applications at scale, with several years in engineering leadership roles</li>
<li>Have led teams that shipped products used by millions of users, with a track record of delivering high-quality, responsive, and accessible interfaces</li>
<li>Remain deeply technical despite your leadership responsibilities—you can dive into the code, debug complex issues, and make informed architectural tradeoffs</li>
<li>Have strong opinions on product and design, developed through years of building consumer experiences, and can advocate effectively for the user</li>
<li>Excel at cross-functional partnership and can build trust quickly with Product, Design, Research, and other stakeholders</li>
<li>Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can balance speed with quality</li>
<li>Are excited by the challenge of building interfaces for AI-powered products, where the interaction paradigms are still being invented</li>
<li>Care deeply about craft—you notice the details that make an experience feel polished and intuitive</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience building products across multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android, desktop, browser extensions) and understanding the unique constraints of each</li>
<li>Background in building real-time, interactive applications where latency and performance are critical</li>
<li>Experience with modern frontend frameworks and architectures (React, React Native, TypeScript, etc.)</li>
<li>Familiarity with AI/ML-powered products and the unique UX challenges they present</li>
<li>A track record of building and scaling engineering teams through periods of rapid growth</li>
<li>Experience establishing frontend platform capabilities that enable faster iteration across multiple product surfaces</li>

<p>Our goal is to build AI that millions of people use every day—to think, create, learn, and accomplish what matters to them. As Head of Consumer Product at Anthropic, you will be a key strategic leader driving our consumer product vision and bringing Claude to everyone.</p>
<p>We're looking for an exceptional product leader who has built consumer products at scale, deeply understands what makes experiences intuitive and indispensable, ships products that people love and tell their friends about, and is eager to dive into everything from interaction design to retention strategy. The best candidates will be extremely hands-on, obsessed with user experience, and opinionated about a future where AI genuinely improves people's daily lives.</p>
<p>You'll work on new consumer experiences at the frontier of what's possible with AI. You'll partner with research, design, and engineering to translate breakthrough model capabilities into products people actually want to use. Ultimately you'll help us build the AI assistant that millions of people choose for their most important work and creative pursuits.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>

<li><strong>User Champion</strong>: Deeply understand what drives people to try, love, and recommend Claude. Build feedback systems that surface user needs, identify friction, and inform product priorities. Drive sustainable growth through product excellence.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Product Excellence:</strong> Ship experiences that feel considered: intuitive interactions, thoughtful defaults, and capabilities that surprise and delight. Obsess over the details that create products people love—onboarding flows, error states, performance, and polish.</li>
<li><strong>Product Execution at Scale</strong>: Partner with engineering and design on products serving millions of daily users. Navigate the unique challenges of consumer AI: managing user expectations, building trust, ensuring safety, and creating experiences that work for everyone from students to professionals to casual users.</li>
<li><strong>Research Partnership</strong>: Work closely with research to identify which model capabilities will most delight users. Partner with trust &amp; safety to build products that are both capable and responsible. Collaborate with marketing and communications to tell Claude's story authentically.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10+ years of progressive experience in product management, including at least 5 years in senior roles leading consumer products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track record of building consumer products with millions of users that people genuinely love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciation for the responsibility that comes with building AI products people rely on daily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep experience with consumer growth, retention, and engagement and opinions about what metrics actually matter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong design sensibility and experience partnering closely with design teams on consumer experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience building products where user trust and safety are core to the value proposition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with AI or ML-powered products and a perspective on how AI will change consumer software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated success building and leading high-performing product teams</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

<li>Understand how datacenter legal structures interact with the compute capacity they will house e.g., power requirements, cooling specifications, security standards, and expansion rights all flow from decisions made elsewhere in the Compute organization</li>
<li>Escalate novel structures or terms that create downstream risk for Anthropic’s operational flexibility to managers; ensure facility designs accommodate AI-specific requirements including high-density power, liquid cooling infrastructure, and rapid scaling capacity</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You might be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>

<li>Comfort with project finance structures and the interplay between lease, financing, and development agreements</li>
<li>Ability to coordinate effectively with specialized outside counsel while maintaining strategic direction</li>
<li>Strong judgment about when deal terms create downstream risk for operational flexibility</li>
<li>Effective collaboration skills for working with business teams who handle transaction management and site selection</li>
<li>Communication skills that translate complex real estate and financing concepts into clear risk assessments for business stakeholders</li>
<li>Genuine interest in infrastructure development and appreciation for why datacenter capacity is mission-critical for frontier AI</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<li>Partner with Product to influence roadmap priorities based on market feedback and competitive positioning</li>
<li>Collaborate with demand generation and brand marketing to amplify product narratives across channels</li>
<li>Establish and track success metrics that tie product marketing efforts to pipeline, revenue, and adoption outcomes</li>

<li>Excel at crafting positioning and messaging that resonates with technical and business audiences alike</li>
<li>Have a track record of successful product launches that drove measurable business impact</li>
<li>Can operate at both strategic and tactical levels—comfortable setting vision and rolling up your sleeves to ship</li>
<li>Thrive in cross-functional environments and have experience influencing product roadmaps through market insights</li>
<li>Are energized by ambiguity and moving fast in a rapidly evolving market</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">Strong candidates may have</h2>

<li>Travel to customer sites, startup-focused events, and industry conferences for workshops, technical deep dives, and relationship building</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<li>Transform partners into AI-native organizations through Claude Code enablement and internal business process evolution, to empower them to operate more effectively and build for where AI capabilities are headed</li>
<li>Design and lead cohort-based accelerators to scale our expertise and impact to multiple organizations simultaneously</li>
<li>Identify patterns across partners and segments to inform what we build at the ecosystem level—MCPs, evals, and other cross-partnership infrastructure</li>
<li>Create technical presentations, demos, and scalable technical content (documentation, tutorials, sample code) to accelerate partner adoption and self-service</li>
<li>Travel occasionally to customer sites for workshops, technical deep dives, and relationship building</li>

<li>Familiarity with common LLM implementation patterns, prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, agent frameworks, and retrieval frameworks</li>

<h2>How we're different</h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

How do we know our graders are accurate?</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of applied ML research and engineering. You'll design experiments to improve how we evaluate model behavior, then ship those methods into pipelines that inform model training and deployment decisions. Your work will directly shape how Anthropic understands and improves the safety of our models across misuse, prompt injection, and user well-being.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design and run experiments to improve evaluation quality—developing methods to generate representative test data, simulate realistic user behavior, and validate grading accuracy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research how different factors (multi-turn conversations, tools, long context, user diversity) impact model safety behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze evaluation coverage to identify gaps and inform where we need better measurement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Productionize successful research into evaluation pipelines that run during model training, launch and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with Policy and Enforcement to translate real-world harm patterns into measurable evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build tooling that enables policy experts to create and iterate on evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surface findings to research and training teams to drive upstream model improvements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 4+ years of software engineering or ML engineering experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are proficient in Python and comfortable working across the stack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have experience building and maintaining data pipelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are comfortable with data analysis and can draw insights from large datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have experience with LLMs and understand their capabilities and failure modes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can move fluidly between prototyping and production-quality code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are excited by ambiguous problems and can translate them into concrete experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care deeply about AI safety and want your work to have real impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Strong candidates may also have experience with:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Join Anthropic's Customer Success team as an EMEA based Customer Success Manager as we pioneer the future of enterprise AI adoption.

<p>You'll develop genuine partnerships with customers, gaining a deep understanding of their business objectives, strategic direction, AI vision, and technical needs. You'll draw on both your business acumen and technical expertise to serve as a strategic advisor throughout their journey with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In partnership with the broader account team you will help customers identify the right Claude capabilities for their specific business objectives, working closely with them to provide best practices and guidance while supporting them as their usage (consumption &amp; seat based) grows and evolves.</p>
<p>Your role focuses on helping customers scale their usage effectively, implement change management strategies, optimize use cases, and maximize the value of their investment through expanded use cases across their organization.&nbsp; The insights you gather from your customers will directly inform our research priorities, product development, and go-to-market strategies — making you a key voice in shaping how we build and deliver ongoing value as a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of our early CSMs in EMEA, you'll be a pioneer - helping to build regional processes, establishing new customer relationships, and representing Anthropic's brand in a high-growth market. You'll operate with significant autonomy while maintaining strong alignment with global teams, requiring someone who thrives in ambiguous environments and can work effectively across time zones.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Build trusting, strategic relationships with key EMEA customer decision makers to understand their business and objectives, identifying opportunities for optimization and expansion</li>

<li>Monitor usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities, proactively addressing underutilization across both consumption-based (API) and seat-based (Claude for Enterprise / Claude Code) products to drive full value from contracted commitments</li>
<li>Serve as the customer’s thought partner, enhancing their knowledge of Claude products by socializing Anthropic’s product roadmap, driving awareness on new products and engaging Product PMs as the voice of EMEA customers</li>
<li>Document and quantify customer value realized through business outcomes, ROI, and impact metrics to build compelling internal business cases for continued and expanded investment</li>
<li>Identify potential use cases and lines of business not currently onboarded, partnering with customers to discover new applications for Claude across different departments, teams, and workflows</li>
<li>Develop and execute change management strategies to drive end-user adoption and maximize value within customer organizations, including Train the Trainer programs, Center of Excellence development, and organizational enablement</li>
<li>Own the customer experience across their lifecycle — managing comprehensive account and success plans grounded in the customer's business objectives, conducting Quarterly Business Reviews, and serving as the primary conduit between the customer and Anthropic</li>
<li>Build Anthropic's brand and customer relationships as a member of the first in-region CS team, developing EMEA-specific processes, playbooks, and best practices where needed that account for regional business cultures</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>6+ years of experience in customer-facing roles (Customer Success, Consulting, Solutions Architect, Solutions/ Functional Consultant, Success Engineer or similar)</li>
<li>Experience driving success across both consumption-based and seat-based business models, with understanding of different expansion levers and success metrics for each</li>
<li>Technical fluency with ability to understand and articulate AI/ML concepts, API integrations, and software implementation patterns</li>
<li>Experience explaining and demonstrating technical products to various audiences</li>

<li>Passion for AI and interest in responsible development of advanced systems</li>
<li>Experience working in and building a growing region, while navigating across time zones with US-based headquarters</li>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for a Recruiting Systems Analyst to build the integrations and automations that power our recruiting function at scale. You'll work at the intersection of recruiting operations, AI application, and systems engineering—building API integrations, automating workflows across the candidate lifecycle, and ensuring data flows correctly between systems.</p>
<p>We're looking for someone who can see a manual process, understand the recruiting context behind it, and ship a working solution. The ideal candidate has experience working within the recruiting or people function and picked up technical skills along the way—or has deep integration experience and genuine curiosity about how talent acquisition actually works. Either way, you understand that the best automation respects the human moments in recruiting while eliminating the tedious ones.</p>
<h2>What You'll Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build and maintain integrations between recruiting tools (Greenhouse, Gem,&nbsp;ModernLoop, BrightHire) using APIs, webhooks, and automation platforms like Tines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate manual workflows across the candidate lifecycle—from sourcing to offer to&nbsp;onboarding handoffs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner with Recruiting Operations to identify high-impact automation opportunities and&nbsp;translate them into technical solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Own the full lifecycle from discovery through deployment: scoping requirements with&nbsp;recruiting users, building prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating to production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshoot and resolve integration issues, ensuring data flows correctly between&nbsp;systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create documentation and lightweight enablement resources so the team can maintain&nbsp;and extend your work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with internal engineering departments on shared infrastructure while owning&nbsp;the "middle layer" of recruiting-specific automations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 5+ years of experience in recruiting operations, talent systems, HR technology, or&nbsp;a similar function—you understand recruiting workflows and why they exist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have hands-on experience building automations and integrations using platforms like&nbsp;Tines, Workato, Zapier, or similar tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are comfortable working with APIs, webhooks—you can read API documentation and&nbsp;build working integrations independently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have used scripting languages (Python, JavaScript) to solve problems, even if you're not&nbsp;a software engineer by training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excel at translating business problems into technical solutions—you ask the right&nbsp;questions to understand what recruiters actually need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a track record of building trust with non-technical stakeholders and shipping&nbsp;products they actually use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are willing to do the unglamorous work: sometimes the right solution is a well-built spreadsheet, sometimes it's a complex multi-system integration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are excited about AI's potential to transform knowledge work and care about building&nbsp;systems that are safe and beneficial</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI application development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience administering Greenhouse at a configuration and API level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Familiarity with Workday integrations and HRIS data flows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with data analysis, reporting tools, or building dashboards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of compliance considerations in recruiting (EEOC, GDPR, etc.)</p>
</li>

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>

<h2 class="heading"><strong>About Beneficial Deployments</strong></h2>
<p>Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences, focusing on raising the floor.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for a Program Manager to shape and grow our global education initiatives. You'll build and manage partnerships with organizations serving the world's most underserved learners, from students in Sub-Saharan Africa gaining internet access for the first time to teachers in India with minimal training and resources.</p>
<p>This is a foundational role where you'll shape our strategy for deploying AI tutors and teaching assistants across India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. You'll work with partners building solutions on top of the Claude API that function in low-connectivity environments, teach in local languages, and prove that world-class education isn't a luxury good.</p>
<p>The right person will combine deep relationships in global education, technical fluency with LLMs, and the entrepreneurial drive to build something new at the frontier of AI.</p>
<p><em>This role is distinct from our Account Executive function: while AEs drive scaled adoption of Anthropic's core products, Program Managers build deep partnerships that require custom deployments, research collaboration, and hands-on program design. You'll work with a smaller portfolio of flagship partners where the goal is driving impact metrics and creating learnings that benefit the broader ecosystem.</em></p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role:</strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking a Revenue Systems Solution Architect to join our Finance team at Anthropic. In this role, you will own the design, implementation, and optimization of our revenue recognition and billing systems infrastructure. As we continue to scale our consumption-based business model, you will be instrumental in building the systems foundation that enables accurate revenue recognition, streamlined quote-to-cash processes, and efficient month-end close.</p>
<p>This is a hands-on role where you'll architect solutions, configure systems, and solve complex technical challenges directly. You'll work at the intersection of Finance, Accounting, and Sales Operations, ensuring our revenue systems accurately reflect the complexities of ASC 606 compliance while supporting Anthropic's growth trajectory. If you thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy building scalable financial infrastructure from the ground up, come join us in our mission to build safe, transformative AI.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Own the architecture, implementation, and administration of revenue recognition systems (such as Zuora Revenue, Salesforce Revenue Cloud, or similar platforms), ensuring ASC 606 compliance for consumption-based business models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and maintain CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) systems architecture, including Salesforce CPQ, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Nue.io" target="_blank">Nue.io</a>, or equivalent platforms, ensuring seamless integration with downstream billing and revenue systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead month-end close processes related to revenue recognition, identifying and resolving reconciliation issues, automation opportunities, and process bottlenecks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architect integrations between CPQ, billing, revenue recognition, and ERP systems to create a cohesive quote-to-cash technology stack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and maintain technical documentation, data flow diagrams, and system configuration guides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner with Accounting, FP&amp;A, and Sales Operations teams to translate business requirements into scalable technical solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshoot complex revenue recognition scenarios, particularly those unique to consumption and usage-based pricing models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive continuous improvement of revenue systems, identifying opportunities for automation and enhanced accuracy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support audit readiness by maintaining clear system controls, documentation, and data integrity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 7+ years of experience implementing and administering revenue recognition systems such as Zuora Revenue, Salesforce Revenue Cloud, RevPro, or similar platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have deep expertise in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards, particularly as applied to consumption-based and usage-based business models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have hands-on experience with CPQ platforms (Salesforce CPQ, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Nue.io" target="_blank">Nue.io</a>, DealHub, or similar) and their integration with billing and revenue systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a track record of solving complex month-end close issues and optimizing revenue accounting processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are comfortable working directly in systems—configuring, troubleshooting, and building solutions yourself rather than solely managing vendors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possess strong understanding of quote-to-cash processes and the technical architecture that supports them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrive in unstructured environments and are energized by building processes and systems from the ground up</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have experience with NetSuite, Stripe, or Metronome integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have worked at high-growth technology companies with complex, evolving revenue models</p>

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>The Global Partner Sales Manager for Systems Integrators will serve as the strategic architect and executive owner of Anthropic's relationships with up to three tier-one global systems integrators. This role demands a seasoned enterprise partnership sales manager who can orchestrate multiple complex, multi-dimensional global relationships simultaneously, spanning co-selling, channel enablement, solution development, and joint go-to-market execution across each partner. The successful candidate will be accountable for transforming these GSI partners into billion-dollar Claude revenue engines, nurturing their growth from initial enablement through to scaled, industry-specific practices that deliver transformative customer solutions powered by Claude.<br><br></p>
<p>This is a high-stakes, execution-focused role requiring someone who can operate at the C-suite level with multiple GSI partners' global leadership while simultaneously driving tactical wins across priority markets and industry verticals. You will own the strategic roadmap, investment prioritization, development plans, and revenue accountability for a portfolio of partnerships that will collectively become critical drivers of Anthropic's enterprise growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Multi-Partner Portfolio Management</strong></p>
<p>You will own and orchestrate the complete 360-degree relationship with up to three major systems integrators across all dimensions: sell-to (partners as customers), sell-with (joint selling to enterprise accounts), and sell-through (partner-led channel sales). This requires balancing investment across your partner portfolio, determining which partners lead in which industries and geographies, and architecting each partnership for maximum mutual value creation. You will be personally accountable for the aggregate contribution of your partner portfolio and responsible for establishing the metrics, governance, and strategic frameworks that ensure all partners are progressing toward their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Development and Practice Building</strong></p>
<p>You will nurture each partner from early-stage enablement through to mature, scaled practices capable of delivering comprehensive industry and segment-specific solutions. This means working with partner leadership to define practice vision and architecture, co-developing go-to-market strategies by industry vertical, and establishing the organizational structures, talent models, and solution portfolios that enable each partner to build expansive global Anthropic practices. You will guide partners in creating repeatable customer solutions that address specific use cases across industries including financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, public sector, and professional services.</p>
<p><strong>Training, Enablement and Certification</strong></p>
<p>You will design and oversee comprehensive enablement programs that transform your partners' workforces into Claude experts and advocates. This includes building training curricula spanning technical implementation, solution architecture, industry applications, and business value articulation. You will establish certification programs that create tiers of expertise within each partner organization, develop enablement materials that scale globally, and ensure partners understand competitive differentiation and can confidently position Claude against alternative AI platforms. Success means creating thousands of enabled professionals across your partner portfolio who can design, build, and deliver production-grade agentic solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Industry and Segment Solution Development</strong></p>
<p>You will collaborate with each partner to build declarative, production-grade solutions powered by Claude that address specific industry challenges and segment use cases. This means partnering with their industry practices to identify high-value use cases, co-developing reference architectures and solution accelerators, and ensuring each partner builds a differentiated solution portfolio that showcases Claude's unique capabilities. You will drive the creation of industry-specific offerings spanning areas such as intelligent document processing, customer service transformation, software development acceleration, research and analysis automation, regulatory compliance, and decision support systems.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Generation and Market Leadership</strong></p>
<p>You will lead the pursuit and closure of market-tipping deals across your partner portfolio that establish Claude as the enterprise standard for agentic AI. This means building executive relationships within each partner's C-suite, identifying and influencing their largest transformation opportunities, and ensuring Claude is positioned as the foundational technology for their agentic enterprise vision. A primary measure of success will be the velocity at which each partner builds a billion-dollar Claude practice, with clear milestones and accountability mechanisms you establish and drive across your portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Success and Lifetime Value</strong></p>
<p>Every deal influenced through your partner portfolio must be architected for customer success and long-term value expansion. You will establish success criteria for joint accounts, ensure proper implementation and adoption support, and create feedback loops that drive continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>GSI Partnership Expertise</strong></p>
<p>You have 8+ years of direct experience managing strategic partnerships with tier-one systems integrators. You possess the ability to nurture or have existing VP+ level relationships across multiple GSIs and understand how to navigate their complex organizational matrices. You have previously owned partnership portfolios generating $250M+ in aggregate influenced or direct revenue and have experience balancing investment and prioritization across multiple strategic partners simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Development and Practice Building</strong></p>
<p>You have successfully nurtured partners from early stages through to scaled practices, understanding the developmental journey from initial enablement to mature, revenue-generating organizations. You know how to build partner business plans, establish practice architectures, develop enablement programs at scale, and measure partner maturity and progression. You have experience helping partners build industry-specific and use-case-driven solutions that create repeatable revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Platform Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>You have built partnerships in high-growth technology categories (cloud platforms, enterprise software, AI/ML) where partner enablement, competitive positioning, technical differentiation, and solution development were critical success factors. You understand how to translate technical capabilities into business value propositions that resonate with enterprise buyers and partner sales organizations across diverse industry verticals.</p>
<p><strong>Global Operating Model and Portfolio Management</strong></p>
<p>You have operated successfully in partner roles requiring coordination across multiple geographies, cultures, and time zones while simultaneously managing multiple strategic partner relationships. You understand how to establish global frameworks while enabling regional execution, prioritize investment across a partner portfolio based on strategic value and maturity, and build virtual teams that span partner and internal resources across continents.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Accountability and Commercial Acumen</strong></p>
<p>You have carried revenue targets in previous roles with forecasting, and the financial mechanics of channel partnerships. You are comfortable with ambitious growth targets across a portfolio and know how to build bottoms-up models that connect activity to revenue outcomes. You understand how to balance short-term revenue delivery with long-term partner development and investment.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Success Profile:</strong></h2>
<p>The ideal candidate combines strategic vision with relentless execution discipline and the organizational capability to manage multiple complex partnerships simultaneously. You are equally comfortable presenting Anthropic's strategic vision to a GSI's Global CEO as you are rolling up your sleeves to rescue a stuck deal or workshop an industry solution with a partner's practice team. You have the gravitas to influence senior executives across multiple organizations while maintaining the hunger and urgency of a quota-carrying seller.</p>
<p>You are obsessively competitive and bring deep conviction about how to win in the market across diverse industries and use cases. You understand the AI landscape, can articulate Claude's technical and philosophical differentiation, and have the credibility to challenge partners when they're not positioning us effectively. You are energized by building and nurturing, understanding that creating multiple billion-dollar partnerships requires both visionary thinking and daily operational excellence across your portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.

              <div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking a pragmatic generalist to help grow capacity for our ongoing efforts to execute on (as well as improve) Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our RSP is a series of technical and organizational protocols that we have adopted to help us manage the risks of developing increasingly capable AI systems. Among other things, it involves maintaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward-looking plans</strong> for improving risk mitigation across the areas of Security, Alignment, and Safeguards. To maintain these plans, we work with stakeholders from across the company to set and iterate on ambitious but achievable goals, regularly check in on whether we’re on track to meet the goals, and problem-solve as needed to fulfill their spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing assessments</strong> of how well we are executing on the vision of our RSP —especially the extent to which our AI systems may or may not pose catastrophic risks, in light of their capabilities as well as our risk mitigations. We monitor developments in our AIs’ capabilities, and changes in our risk mitigations, to keep these up to date and ensure that any adjustments to our operational practices are made deliberately and thoughtfully.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the company grows and AI capabilities improve, executing on our RSP is becoming increasingly important, complex, and cross-functional. Our RSP team works to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set and check in on forward-looking goals for improving risk mitigations.</li>
<li>Check in on activity across the company to ensure that our activities and risk mitigations are in line with the RSP.</li>
<li>Partner with the Security, Alignment, and Safeguards teams to develop practical and effective risk mitigation strategies.</li>
<li>Propose RSP revisions to reflect what we’re learning.</li>
<li>Collaborate with our Policy team when the RSP is relevant to regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This role offers a unique opportunity to work on the nuts and bolts of AI risk reduction, interacting with many different parts of the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success in this role means learning quickly about many aspects of our business; combining this with a deep understanding of the major catastrophic risks potentially posed by advanced AI; and bringing a pragmatic problem-solving attitude, constantly looking for the best and most practical ways to achieve risk reduction.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>In this role, you will:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Build relationships with internal experts on Safeguards, Security, Alignment, capability evaluations, and other relevant areas.</li>
<li>Learn about ongoing questions and challenges faced by these teams, and help to find the best balance between AI risk reduction and pragmatism.</li>
<li>Gather information from across the company and assist in analyzing relevant risks.</li>
<li>Help to drive conversations about the ambitious-but-achievable plans we can make to level up our risk mitigations.</li>
<li>Collaborate with our Policy team, advising on regulation relevant to RSPs.</li>
<li>Generally work to identify the most promising risk mitigations to be further developed and/or exported to the rest of the AI industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have (or can quickly develop) a deep understanding of major catastrophic risks potentially posed by advanced AI.</li>
<li>Are passionate about reducing the harms and improving the benefits of AI&nbsp; and align with Anthropic's safety mission and commitment to responsible AI development</li>
<li>Are a pragmatic problem-solver who relishes the opportunity to find the best balance between the goal of reducing catastrophic risks and staying on the frontier of AI development.</li>
<li>Can write quickly and clearly in a way that gives audiences an easy time understanding your reasoning and justifications for your claims</li>
<li>Are a flexible generalist who is excited to learn about many topics and evolve your work in unanticipated directions as we contend with a rapidly changing AI landscape</li>
<li>Are highly organized and excel at managing multiple projects simultaneously, maintaining clear priorities and delivering on tight timelines</li>
<li>Are comfortable operating in ambiguous environments, taking ownership of problems, and proactively driving initiatives with limited precedent</li>
<li>Are scrappy and hard-working, but also humble, genuinely collaborative, and a strong team player</li>
<li>Hold at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field</li>
</ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>Come work with us!</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. <strong data-stringify-type="bold">Guidance on Candidates' AI Usage:</strong>&nbsp;Learn about&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" data-sk="tooltip_parent">our policy</a>&nbsp;for using AI in our application process</p></div>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a class="c-link c-link--underline" href="http://anthropic.com/careers" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="http://anthropic.com/careers" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">anthropic.com/careers</a></u>&nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.</p>
<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
<h2><strong>Come work with us!</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. <strong data-stringify-type="bold">Guidance on Candidates' AI Usage:</strong>&nbsp;Learn about&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance" data-sk="tooltip_parent">our policy</a>&nbsp;for using AI in our application process</p></div>
