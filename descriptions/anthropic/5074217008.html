<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>We’re looking for research engineers with a strong computer vision background who believe that visual and spatial reasoning are core to fully unlocking the capabilities of LLMs. In this role, you'll work on research, development, and evaluation for state-of-the-art Claude models, with a focus on visual and spatial capabilities. This role is highly collaborative and will touch many aspects of our broader research efforts, taking a full-stack approach across pretraining, RL, and runtime techniques like agentic harnesses. Additionally, you’ll partner with the product org to ensure that the vision improvements you deliver impact Claude’s performance on real-world tasks.</p>
<h2><strong>What you'll do:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run experiments to evaluate architectural variants, data strategies, and SL and RL techniques to improve Claude’s vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and test tools, skills, and agentic infrastructure that enable Claude to reason over visual inputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create evaluations and benchmarks that measure progress on multimodal capabilities across training and deployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with our product org to find solutions to our most vexing API customer challenges related to vision and spatial reasoning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 7+ years of ML, computer vision, and software engineering experience through industry, academia, or other projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are familiar with the architecture, training, and operation of large vision language models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have experience creating and evaluating large synthetic and real-world visual training datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have experience engaging in systematic prompting, finetuning, or evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy pair programming and cross-team collaboration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care about the societal impacts of your work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have experience with:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Large-scale pretraining, SL, and RL on language models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning research on images, video, or other modalities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing complex agentic systems using LLMs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-performance ML systems (GPUs, TPUs, JAX, PyTorch)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large-scale ETL and data pipeline development</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Representative projects:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Running experiments to determine ideal training datamixes and parameters for a synthetically generated vision dataset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finetuning Claude to maximize its performance using a particular set of agent tools/skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a pipeline to ingest and process a novel source of visual training data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing and running experiments to evaluate the scalability of two architectural variants</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
