<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Technical Program Manager for model evaluations, you'll own end-to-end coordination of our evaluation ecosystem— building a feedback loop from shaping eval strategy during early model development through launch execution. You'll be the critical bridge between Research, Product, Marketing, and Engineering teams.</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of frontier AI research and product launches. Evals are an important part of how we measure whether our models meet the bar—for capability, safety, and competitive positioning. Beyond launch coordination, you'll help scale our evals ecosystem: from early-stage model evals for RL environments, to the systems and infrastructure on which evals run, to tooling that enables the whole pipeline. A strong TPM in this space can immediately reduce chaos during launches while also driving systemic improvements that compound over time.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Launch Coordination</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Standardize how evaluation results are generated, documented, compared across model versions, and communicated to stakeholders</li>
<li>Own end-to-end eval readiness for model launches—tracking which evals are ready, which need scores on past models, and which meet the bar for marketing materials</li>
<li>Establish and enforce clear criteria for eval inclusion: scores on historical models, state-of-the-art performance, and competitor comparisons</li>
<li>Coordinate between research teams, marketing, and product to consolidate eval status into a single source of truth</li>
<li>Maintain a high bar: ensure reported statistics reflect model capabilities in an honest, accurate, and transparent way</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Get involved early in model development cycles, helping shape eval plans for RL environments&nbsp;</li>
<li>Partner with research and infrastructure teams to improve underlying evals infrastructure—eval-syncer reliability, results storage and querying, automation capabilities</li>
<li>Drive prioritization of eval tooling enhancements based on researcher needs</li>
<li>Identify patterns across launches and drive systemic fixes rather than point solutions</li>
<li>Work with PMs and researchers to improve and implement high priority evals launches</li>
<li>Maintain and prioritize the eval roadmap—working with cross-functional teams to identify which new evals are needed for upcoming launches and product requirements</li>
<li>Implement an operating model that reflects an evals environment with increasing complexity&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading"><strong>Process &amp; Systems</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Build lightweight but rigorous tracking systems—moving key information into structured formats that enable better decision-making</li>
<li>Create eval dashboards that provide real-time visibility into training progress on hero evals, enabling earlier intervention when scores look concerning</li>
<li>Document eval processes, requirements, and lessons learned to build institutional knowledge</li>
<li>Coordinate compute allocation for large-scale evals with infrastructure teams</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5+ years of technical program management experience with a track record of bringing order to chaotic, high-stakes coordination problems</li>
<li>Possess scientific depth and a very high quality bar for data</li>
<li>Have experience with ML/AI evaluation methodologies, benchmarking, or research quality assurance</li>
<li>Have a background in research operations, scientific publishing, or data quality management</li>
<li>Have previous experience as data analyst, data scientist, or software engineer</li>
<li>Can build trust with research teams by understanding their work deeply enough to add value beyond coordination</li>
<li>Are skilled at cross-functional coordination involving research, product, marketing, and engineering—navigating competing priorities and driving alignment</li>
<li>Have working familiarity with data analysis tools (SQL, Python, or similar) for querying eval results and building dashboards</li>
<li>Have familiarity with LLM capabilities and limitations and experience working with AI research teams</li>
<li>Excel at written and verbal communication, translating technical nuance for marketing stakeholders while maintaining precision</li>
<li>Thrive in unstructured environments with a bias toward action and a knack for creating clarity in ambiguous situations</li>
<li>Have extremely high ownership and attention to detail</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
