<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About Beneficial Deployments</strong></h2>
<p>Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences, focusing on raising the floor.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for a Program Manager to shape and grow our global education initiatives. You'll build and manage partnerships with organizations serving the world's most underserved learners, from students in Sub-Saharan Africa gaining internet access for the first time to teachers in India with minimal training and resources.</p>
<p>This is a foundational role where you'll shape our strategy for deploying AI tutors and teaching assistants across India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. You'll work with partners building solutions on top of the Claude API that function in low-connectivity environments, teach in local languages, and prove that world-class education isn't a luxury good.</p>
<p>The right person will combine deep relationships in global education, technical fluency with LLMs, and the entrepreneurial drive to build something new at the frontier of AI.</p>
<p><em>This role is distinct from our Account Executive function: while AEs drive scaled adoption of Anthropic's core products, Program Managers build deep partnerships that require custom deployments, research collaboration, and hands-on program design. You'll work with a smaller portfolio of flagship partners where the goal is driving impact metrics and creating learnings that benefit the broader ecosystem.</em></p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
