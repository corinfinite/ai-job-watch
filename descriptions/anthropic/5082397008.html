<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently announced a transformative strategic partnership with Microsoft, positioning Claude as the only frontier AI model available across all three major cloud platforms. This partnership includes a $30 billion Azure compute commitment and represents one of the most significant AI-cloud partnerships in the industry. <br><br>We're looking for a leader to build this partnership from the ground up into a multi-billion-dollar business.</p>
<p>As Head of Azure Partnership, you will define and execute the strategy for Anthropic's Microsoft relationship — spanning Azure AI Foundry, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Copilot Studio. You'll build a team, establish executive relationships across Microsoft's global organization, and create the co-sell and go-to-market motions that drive Claude adoption at enterprise scale. This is a greenfield opportunity to shape how a landmark AI-cloud partnership is commercialized.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define the strategic vision for Anthropic's Microsoft partnership, including annual business planning, multi-year revenue targets, joint roadmap development, and executive-level operational cadences (MBRs, QBRs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and lead a high-performing team, scaling to 6-8 people in the first year with international coverage across EMEA and APAC — with potential to grow significantly as the partnership matures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish and own executive relationships across Microsoft's field organization, Azure leadership, and product teams at the most senior levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive partner-sourced and partner-influenced revenue from inception toward a multi-billion-dollar annual run rate, building forecasting models and pipeline management across Strategic, Major, and Enterprise accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and track field activation metrics — driving measurable engagement from Microsoft sellers and solutions architects on Claude opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, Trust &amp; Safety, and Legal to ensure successful integration and deployment of Claude across Microsoft's ecosystem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create scalable co-selling motions, enablement programs, and joint customer engagement frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent Anthropic in high-stakes executive meetings and strategic negotiations with Microsoft leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with GSI/SI partnerships (Accenture, Deloitte, etc.) on cloud-influenced enterprise deals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>

<p>15+ years of experience in partnerships, business development, or GTM leadership at technology companies, with deep experience managing strategic cloud provider relationships at scale</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Proven track record building and scaling teams in high-growth environments, from early stages through significant organizational growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep understanding of enterprise cloud services, AI/ML market dynamics, and the Microsoft ecosystem specifically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceptional executive presence and the ability to build trusted relationships with the most senior leaders across complex, matrixed organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong business acumen paired with technical credibility — you can engage with solutions architects and hold your own in discussions about AI capabilities and enterprise deployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comfort with ambiguity and rapid iteration; you can build an organization and its processes from scratch while delivering results in parallel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comfort with rigorous pipeline management, partner activation metrics, and data-driven operating rhythms</p>
</li>

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
