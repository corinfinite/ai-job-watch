<p>Anthropic is seeking an exceptional Contracts Manager to support commercial and technology transactions. We'll rely on you to help review, draft, and negotiate commercial and procurement contracts to support our cutting-edge AI systems.

<li>Collaborate with the Product, Sales, Business Operations, Research, and Procurement teams to achieve key business objectives and deliver strategic, business-minded, and solutions-focused counsel</li>
<li>As a relatively small legal team supporting big things, each legal team member practices across multiple areas. We’d love to hear where else you’d be interested to pitch in, whether as a function of your experience or interests</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You might be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>At least 5 years of related contract management experience, with at least 3 years of experience supporting technology transactions, sales organizations, or partnerships&nbsp;</li>
<li>Experience operating in a fast-paced technology startup in which priorities shift rapidly and schedules "move to the left," thriving in this dynamic environment and priding yourself on your adaptability and ability to pivot with speed and grace</li>
<li>Initiative and autonomy in managing complex contractual matters, effectively prioritizing competing deadlines</li>
<li>An understanding of what's important in the context of a contract, the organization's mission, when to be flexible, and when to draw a hard line</li>
<li>Excitement to grow with an organization and help shape the culture of the commercial function</li>
<li>A preference for straightforward, concise explanations over legalese and overwrought drafting</li>
<li>A knack for identifying and implementing efficient processes and policies</li>
<li>The ability to thrive as a member of cross-functional teams building frontier technologies, with a desire to develop a deep understanding of our technical teams and what we are building</li>
<li>Comfort operating outside your areas of expertise and in uncharted legal territory</li>
<li>A "doer" mentality, willing to roll up your sleeves to get things done as a team player who doesn't hesitate to jump in to do work that needs to get done, whether glamorous or not</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Proven ability to collaborate across various organizational levels and functions to facilitate efficient contracting processes and execution while building strong relationships</li>
<li>Substantive knowledge of software agreements, reseller agreements, services agreements, strategic partnerships, and general contract terms&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate.

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
