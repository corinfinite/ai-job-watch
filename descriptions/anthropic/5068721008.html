<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role:</strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking a Revenue Systems Solution Architect to join our Finance team at Anthropic. In this role, you will own the design, implementation, and optimization of our revenue recognition and billing systems infrastructure.

You'll work at the intersection of Finance, Accounting, and Sales Operations, ensuring our revenue systems accurately reflect the complexities of ASC 606 compliance while supporting Anthropic's growth trajectory. If you thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy building scalable financial infrastructure from the ground up, come join us in our mission to build safe, transformative AI.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Design and maintain CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) systems architecture, including Salesforce CPQ, <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Nue.io" target="_blank">Nue.io</a>, or equivalent platforms, ensuring seamless integration with downstream billing and revenue systems</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
