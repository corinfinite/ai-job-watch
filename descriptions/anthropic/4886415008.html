<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h1><strong>Recruiting Analytics: Data Analytics &amp; Engineering</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of data engineering and recruiting analytics. You'll build the technical foundation that powers insights about hiring, engagement, performance, and workforce planning while working with a team that's actively experimenting with AI to transform how we understand and support our workforce.</p>
<p>As a key member of our data-driven culture, you'll design scalable data architectures, optimize our analytics infrastructure, and transform raw recruiting data into trusted, reusable datasets. But you'll also need to be scrappy—sometimes the right solution is a well-crafted Google Sheet or a quick prototype, not a fully engineered pipeline. We value creativity and pragmatism alongside technical excellence.</p>
<p>This role offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on how we attract, develop, and retain the exceptional talent needed to advance AI safety.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Data Infrastructure &amp; Modeling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactor and optimize our existing BigQuery tables to create a scalable data foundation that supports traditional BI tools (like Looker) and enables AI-driven insights across the company</li>
<li>Design scalable data architectures and build dimensional models that transform raw recruiting data into trusted, reusable datasets for self-serve analytics while maintaining performance</li>
<li>Model downstream tables for custom reporting and analytics</li>
<li>Implement data governance including documentation, lineage tracking, quality monitoring, and proactive alerting systems</li>

<ul>
<li>Analyze complex datasets to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities across the employee lifecycle</li>
<li>Conduct rigorous statistical analysis to support evidence-based decision-making for talent management initiatives</li>
<li>Perform root cause analysis on people-related metrics to understand underlying drivers of organizational outcomes</li>
<li>Design and execute research projects that advance our understanding of what drives employee success and satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visualization &amp; Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create and maintain interactive dashboards and visualizations that help communicate complex data insights to key stakeholders</li>
<li>Come up with creative solutions to displaying data—whether that's a polished Looker dashboard, a quick Google Sheets prototype, or leveraging AI for novel approaches</li>
<li>Translate complex data analyses into clear, compelling narratives for both technical and non-technical audiences</li>
<li>Convert insights into actionable recommendations and drive implementation of solutions</li>
<li>Collaborate with company leaders to identify, track, and iterate key performance indicators (KPIs) for talent management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cross-Functional Partnerships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Partner with stakeholders to define and scope people analytics projects that align with organizational goals</li>

<li>Have implemented data security and privacy controls in cloud warehouses</li>
<li>Are comfortable working with messy or incomplete data</li>
<li>Possess excellent communication skills and can translate complex analytical findings into actionable business insights</li>
<li>Are creative and scrappy—you know when to build a robust data pipeline and when a Google Sheet with some clever formulas will get the job done faster</li>
<li>Are results-oriented with a bias towards flexibility and impact over perfection</li>
<li>Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams</li>
<li>Care about ensuring that advanced AI systems are developed safely and are passionate about our mission</li>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
