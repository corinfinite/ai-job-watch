<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for an Account Executive to drive Claude adoption across academic medical centers and major teaching hospitals. This is a hunting-heavy role focused on building new relationships with clinical and operational leaders who are exploring how AI can improve patient care, clinical workflows, and administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>You'll partner closely with our Life Sciences team, which builds deep scientific partnerships with research institutions and identifies high-impact deployment opportunities. Your focus is on the clinical and operational side of these institutions—translating interest into commercial agreements, driving new pipeline independently, and expanding Claude's footprint across partner organizations. You'll also collaborate with Account Executives covering affiliated universities to ensure a unified Anthropic presence and identify cross-sell opportunities where academic medical centers and universities share governance or procurement.</p>
<p>Academic medical centers typically don't have large internal development teams, so you'll be selling to buyers who are thinking about integration into clinical systems, EHRs, and operational platforms—not building from scratch.</p>
<p>Note: This role will evolve as we scale. You'll help define the coverage model for academic medical centers as the team grows, and the scope may sharpen over time as we build out dedicated verticals. We're looking for someone energized by that ambiguity, not intimidated by it.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
