<ul>
<li>Design, develop, and maintain tokenization systems used across Pretraining and Finetuning workflows</li>
<li>Optimize encoding techniques to improve model training efficiency and performance</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with research teams to understand their evolving needs around data representation</li>
<li>Build infrastructure that enables researchers to experiment with novel tokenization approaches</li>
<li>Implement systems for monitoring and debugging tokenization-related issues in the model training pipeline</li>
<li>Create robust testing frameworks to validate tokenization systems across diverse languages and data types</li>
<li>Identify and address bottlenecks in data processing pipelines related to tokenization</li>
<li>Document systems thoroughly and communicate technical decisions clearly to stakeholders across teams</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have significant software engineering experience with demonstrated machine learning expertise</li>
<li>Are comfortable navigating ambiguity and developing solutions in rapidly evolving research environments</li>

<li>Have experience with machine learning systems, data pipelines, or ML infrastructure</li>
<li>Are proficient in Python and familiar with modern ML development practices</li>
<li>Have strong analytical skills and can evaluate the impact of engineering changes on research outcomes</li>
<li>Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description</li>
<li>Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)</li>
<li>Care about the societal impacts of your work and are committed to developing AI responsibly</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Working with machine learning data processing pipelines</li>
<li>Building or optimizing data encodings for ML applications</li>
<li>Implementing or working with BPE, WordPiece, or other tokenization algorithms</li>
<li>Performance optimization of ML data processing systems</li>
<li>Multi-language tokenization challenges and solutions</li>
<li>Research environments where engineering directly enables scientific progress</li>
<li>Distributed systems and parallel computing for ML workflows</li>

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
