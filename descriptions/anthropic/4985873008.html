<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As a Portfolio Activation Manager on Anthropic's Private Equity team, you'll build and scale programs that drive AI adoption across private equity portfolio companies. Working closely with Tier 1 PE firms, you'll design and execute scaled enablement programs—webinar series, onboarding cohorts, and hands-on workshops—that activate hundreds of portfolio companies with minimal human touch time.</p>
<p>You'll partner with Value Creation and Operating Partner teams at PE firms to understand portfolio needs, then build automated, repeatable programs that drive bottom-up adoption of Claude products (Claude for Work, Claude Code, and API). This isn't a 1:1 customer success role—it's about designing systems and infrastructure that scale across entire portfolios, turning initial interest into active customers and engaged users.</p>
<p>This is a new role and function at Anthropic. You'll take the foundation that our Commercial and PE GTM leaders have built and turn it into a repeatable playbook. You should be passionate about building at the intersection of program design, automation, and executive stakeholder management.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design and execute scaled activation programs (webinars, onboarding cohorts, office hours, executive events) that reach hundreds of portfolio companies across multiple PE firms</li>
<li>Develop portfolio-specific commercial strategies including preferred pricing models, contract terms, and growth initiatives aligned with PE firm objectives</li>
<li>Own portfolio activation metrics including new customer acquisition, ARR growth, and product engagement across Claude for Work, Claude Code, and API</li>
<li>Manage relationships with PE firm Operating Partners and Value Creation teams, delivering monthly business reviews and quarterly adoption reports</li>
<li>Create enablement content, documentation, and training to help portfolio companies effectively utilize Claude products, and enable Account Executives to navigate PE portfolio dynamics</li>
<li>Gather product feedback from portfolio companies and represent their needs to inform Anthropic's product roadmap and PE-specific features</li>
<li>Plan and execute portfolio-focused events, campaigns, and promotions including on-site executive summits and virtual programming</li>
<li>Coordinate with Account Executives to route qualified leads from portfolio companies and ensure smooth handoffs</li>
<li>Track and report on key metrics to measure the success and ROI of portfolio activation initiatives</li>
<li>Continuously refine programs based on data, feedback, and portfolio company outcomes, building a repeatable playbook that scales across firms</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 5-7 years of experience in B2B SaaS program management, partnerships, sales enablement, revenue operations, or customer education with a proven track record of building scaled programs</li>
<li>Possess strong automation skills and systems thinking—you're comfortable building workflows and infrastructure that eliminate manual work</li>
<li>Have experience presenting to and managing relationships with senior executives (VP+ level), translating technical concepts into business value</li>
<li>Demonstrate a track record of moving fast in ambiguous environments and launching programs quickly with imperfect information</li>
<li>Are comfortable working with technical products and developer tools—you don't need to code, but you should understand AI concepts well enough to explain them clearly</li>
<li>Show self-sufficiency and resourcefulness—you can pull together content, coordinate across teams, and execute without constant oversight</li>
<li>Possess analytical orientation toward metrics and a bias toward measuring what matters (pipeline, revenue, adoption) vs. vanity metrics</li>
<li>Have exceptional communication and relationship-building skills with both technical and business audiences</li>
<li>Can thrive in a fast-paced environment and adapt to changing priorities</li>
<li>Are passionate about the positive impact that AI can have for businesses and society as a whole</li>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
