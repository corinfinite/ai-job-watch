<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p>
<h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>This is a critical leadership role responsible for building and scaling Anthropic's GSI and consulting partner ecosystem across the United Kingdom and Ireland. You will own the strategic partnerships with firms like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, Capgemini, EY, KPMG, and regional players across the UK market.</p>
<p><strong>This is a builder role, not a manager role.</strong> Given Anthropic's stage, we need someone who has proven they can take GSI partnerships from zero to scaled revenue engines — someone who has built these relationships from the ground up, not just inherited and managed existing ones.</p>
<p>You will treat each GSI as a structured sales pursuit with detailed stakeholder mapping, account plans, and targeted engagement strategies. You understand that there are two critical personas that drive partner success: the consultants who recommend tools on client projects, and the Key Account Directors (KADs) who control client access. You know how to engage both.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will bring deep existing relationships at VP+ level within target GSIs across the UK, understand how to drive meaningful KPIs (pipeline, revenue, consultants trained, KADs engaged, joint proposals), and obsess about competitive differentiation in the UK market.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
