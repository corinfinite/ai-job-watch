<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role</h2>
<p>We're looking for a Product Marketing Manager to accelerate the growth of Claude Code, our frontier coding agent. This role sits at the intersection of technical product understanding and go-to-market strategy, serving as the orchestrator who ensures our constant stream of features reaches developers with clarity and impact.</p>
<p>As the PMM for Claude Code, you'll embed deeply with our engineering teams to understand the technical roadmap, then coordinate across marketing, sales, and developer relations to deliver cohesive launches that reinforce our position at the frontier of AI-powered development tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claude Code ships features at an exceptional pace, and we need someone who can build systematic approaches to launch excellence while maintaining the technical fluency to earn credibility with both our engineering teams and developer audience.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Competitive Intelligence:</strong> Monitor the developer tools landscape, particularly competing AI coding assistants, to inform our positioning and identify opportunities for differentiation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">Why this role matters</h2>
<p>Claude Code represents a fundamental shift in how developers write and interact with code. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted development, we need someone who can ensure our innovations reach developers in ways that are both technically credible and impactful. You'll have direct visibility to engineering leadership and the opportunity to shape how one of the industry's most innovative developer tools goes to market.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
