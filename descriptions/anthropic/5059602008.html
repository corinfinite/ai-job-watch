<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the Role</h2>
<p>You will own the physical security posture of all Anthropic-spec data centers. Not managing guards and cameras—architecting defense-in-depth systems that scale from ground break through production, across multiple facilities, against sophisticated and well-resourced adversaries.<br><br>Our version controlled and AI assisted library act as one source of truth, driving consistent outputs and security that enables velocity rather than blocking it. Your job is to make it operational in steel, concrete, and sustained excellence.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Security Program Ownership</strong>- Define and execute the end-to-end physical security roadmap for all Anthropic data centers globally.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Design and Engineering</strong>-&nbsp; Ensure integrated physical security systems (access control, video surveillance, intrusion detection, perimeter security) that work across different types of facilities. Balance security requirements against operational efficiency and construction timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Partnership</strong> - Collaborate with Infrastructure, Operations, and Facilities teams to embed security into the data center lifecycle, from construction gates to steady-state operations.</li>
<li><strong>Risk and Threat Modeling</strong> - Conduct risk assessments and threat modeling for greenfield and brownfield projects. Feed operational learnings back into the Controls framework.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Compliance and Validation</strong> - Partner with Compliance and Legal to ensure physical security systems meet relevant standards,and customer requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Incident Response</strong> - Develop physical security incident response protocols with partners. When something happens, the team knows exactly what to do.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Metrics and Accountability</strong> - Define KPIs that measure actual security posture, system effectiveness, vendor performance, incident metrics, coverage gaps.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have worked with construction teams to integrate security into the build process</li>
<li>Can translate threat models into specific, measurable requirements</li>
<li>Have managed security programs across multiple facilities and geographies simultaneously</li>
<li>Know how to hold vendors accountable without destroying relationships</li>
<li>Can communicate security requirements to engineers, executives, lawyers, and construction managers and get buy-in from all of them</li>
<li>Are comfortable with ambiguity and can make decisions with incomplete information</li>
<li>Are energized by building from the ground up</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strong candidates may have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>10+ years designing, deploying, and managing physical security for high-value compute infrastructure (data centers, critical infrastructure, sensitive facilities)</li>
<li>Hold relevant certifications (PSP, CPP, CISSP, CISM)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deadline to apply:</strong> None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.</p><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
