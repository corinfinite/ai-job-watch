<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking for a Segment Marketing Lead to build and scale marketing programs for our Commercial segment - spanning SMB, mid-market, and private equity-backed companies. This role is about creating repeatable, scalable programs that drive pipeline and revenue across the Commercial business. You’ll design and execute multi-channel initiatives from scratch: events, webinar series, workshops, digital campaigns - and build the playbooks that make them repeatable as the business grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ideal candidate is a hands-on generalist with strong cross-functional skills who thrives building programs from zero. You’re equally comfortable designing a webinar series, running a regional event, orchestrating a digital campaign, and analyzing what worked to improve the next iteration. You bring strong demand generation instincts and a bias toward action - shipping programs, learning fast, and scaling what works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This role is foundational - you’ll be building the Commercial marketing engine and establishing the programs and processes that will define how we engage this segment at scale.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
