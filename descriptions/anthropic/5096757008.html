<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s core technology teams are growing fast—and with that growth comes the need for someone who can build the operational backbone that keeps everything running smoothly while the org scales. We’re looking for a Business Operations leader who thrives in the space between “we need a plan” and “here’s how we’ll execute it.”</p>
<p>You’ll be embedded within our core technology organization—working alongside engineering leaders, finance partners, and cross-functional stakeholders to ensure we’re investing wisely, operating efficiently, and making decisions with the right data in front of us. The role blends strategic thinking with hands-on process design: you’ll build planning frameworks one week and dig into spend analytics the next. Nothing here is inherited—much of what this role owns will be created from scratch.</p>
<p>This is an ideal fit for someone who gets energized by building operational muscle in a technical environment—someone who can hold the big picture while also shipping the spreadsheet, the dashboard, or the new planning cadence that actually changes how people work.</p>
<h2><strong>What the Work Looks Like:</strong></h2>
<p><em>Planning, budgets, and resource strategy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Own annual and quarterly planning for the core tech org—coordinating timelines, synthesizing inputs from engineering leads, and producing plans that connect technical priorities to company-level goals</li>
<li>Manage budget forecasting and ongoing spend visibility, partnering with Finance to ensure investments are tracked, justified, and aligned to outcomes</li>
<li>Build headcount and capacity models that help leadership make informed decisions about where to invest next</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Process design and operational systems</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Design and ship scalable workflows for recurring operational needs—goal-setting, progress tracking, resource allocation, cross-team coordination</li>
<li>Identify bottlenecks and friction points in how the org runs today, then build lightweight solutions that improve speed without adding bureaucracy</li>
<li>Establish measurement frameworks and KPIs that give leadership real signal on organizational health, velocity, and efficiency</li>
<li>Stand up reporting and analytics surfaces that replace ad hoc requests with self-serve visibility</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cross-functional alignment and strategic projects</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Act as the operational hub connecting core tech to adjacent teams—product, go-to-market, security, research—on shared initiatives and dependencies</li>
<li>Drive special projects that don’t have an obvious home: org design questions, vendor evaluations, tooling decisions, or one-time strategic analyses</li>
<li>Prepare materials for leadership reviews, executive updates, and company-wide planning moments where core tech is a key input</li>
<li>Build relationships across the company so that when cross-functional problems arise, you’re already the person people call</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<p><em>Required qualifications</em></p>
<ul>
<li>10+ years of experience in business operations, strategy &amp; operations, chief of staff, or similar roles—ideally within technology companies during periods of meaningful growth</li>
<li>Demonstrated experience building operational processes and planning systems from the ground up, not just maintaining existing ones</li>
<li>Strong analytical toolkit: you’re comfortable with financial modeling, budget management, forecasting, and working in large datasets (SQL proficiency is a plus)</li>
<li>Proven ability to manage complex, multi-stakeholder projects with competing timelines and keep them on track without heavy-handed oversight</li>
<li>Clear, concise communicator who can write a compelling executive memo as easily as a detailed project plan—and knows which one the moment calls for</li>
<li>Experience earning trust and driving outcomes across functions where you don’t have direct authority</li>
<li>Comfort operating in ambiguity—you’ve built the plane while flying it, and you know how to prioritize when everything feels urgent</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Strong candidates may also have</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience embedded within an engineering or core technology organization, with enough technical fluency to be a credible partner to engineering leadership</li>
<li>Background at companies navigating rapid scaling (3x+ growth) where you helped the org avoid the growing pains that typically accompany that trajectory</li>
<li>Familiarity with the tooling and systems common in technical orgs: project management platforms, analytics tools, engineering productivity metrics</li>
<li>Previous experience with resource planning for compute, infrastructure, or platform teams—understanding the unique dynamics of technical capacity decisions</li>
<li>A consulting, finance, or data science background that you’ve since translated into operating roles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
