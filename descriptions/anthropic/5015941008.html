<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role</h2>
<p>This is a foundational leadership role responsible for building the infrastructure, programs, and operational excellence that will power Anthropic's global partner ecosystem. You will own the end-to-end partner experience — from portal and program design, through enablement and certification, to ongoing success and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be the architect of how partners engage with Anthropic globally. You will build the systems, programs, and incentives that ready our ecosystem for scale, while ensuring every partner and their customers achieve the highest levels of success. When things go wrong, you will be the escalation point and problem solver who protects our brand and relationships.</p>
<p>This role requires someone who is both strategic and deeply operational — capable of designing world-class programs while also rolling up their sleeves to resolve critical issues. You obsess about partner and customer success, understanding that ecosystem health is fundamental to Anthropic's mission.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
