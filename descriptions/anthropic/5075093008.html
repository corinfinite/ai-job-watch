<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Strategic Account Executive focused on cybersecurity, you'll own some of Anthropic's most strategic cybersecurity relationships—companies building the next generation of AI-powered security products. These aren't typical enterprise accounts; they're partners shaping how AI transforms the entire security industry.</p>
<p>You'll drive multi-million dollar commitments by expanding Claude's footprint across customer product portfolios (AI-powered SOC, threat detection, security copilots) and internal operations (Claude Code for engineering teams). You'll work at the intersection of executive relationships and technical depth—one week you're in a CTO strategy session, the next you're helping an engineering team scope an agentic deployment.</p>
<p>This role requires someone who can think like a partner, not just a seller. You'll collaborate closely with our Applied AI team on custom deployments, work with Product on cybersecurity-specific capabilities, and help shape Anthropic's go-to-market in one of our highest-potential verticals.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
