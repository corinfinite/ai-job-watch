<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>As a member of the Product Public Policy team, you will lead Anthropic's global privacy policy strategy. You'll work at the intersection of policy, legal, product, and research to shape complex privacy regulations, inform responsible privacy tooling and product development, and build trust with policy stakeholders worldwide. This role combines deep privacy policy expertise with strategic thinking, creative problem-solving, technical acumen, and strong collaboration skills.</p>
<p>As Anthropic's privacy policy lead, you will define our global privacy policy strategy at a critical inflection point for AI regulation. You'll work at the intersection of cutting-edge AI capabilities and evolving privacy frameworks, translating between technical systems, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. This role requires deep privacy expertise combined with the ability to operate in highly ambiguous 0→1 environments where you'll set direction, build consensus, and drive implementation across legal, product, research, and go-to-market teams.</p>
<p>Privacy is foundational to building trustworthy AI systems. You'll lead high-priority initiatives while thinking creatively about novel privacy challenges that don't fit traditional frameworks, such as data access for AI agents, data minimization in foundation model development, and product-embedded user controls.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lead Anthropic's global privacy policy strategy, working across product, research, legal, and xfn teams to develop privacy positions on AI data governance, model training, and privacy-preserving deployment that inform our product roadmap and external advocacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translate complex privacy policy frameworks into actionable product guidance, working closely with legal, research and product teams to build privacy-forward features for consumer and enterprise products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive strategic privacy initiatives such as model privacy legislation for agentic AI systems, white papers on privacy-preserving techniques, and industry coalitions that advance responsible AI development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and manage relationships with key privacy stakeholders including regulators, policymakers, civil society organizations, academics, and industry partners across multiple jurisdictions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and interpret emerging privacy frameworks to proactively identify opportunities and risks for Anthropic's business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop engagement strategies and materials that communicate Anthropic's privacy approach to technical and non-technical audiences</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>8+ years in privacy policy, ideally including significant experience in tech companies working on emerging technologies</p>

<li>
<p>Possess deep expertise in global privacy regulations and how they apply to AI systems, with direct experience navigating GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and/or AI-specific frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have technical fluency with privacy-preserving technologies (differential privacy, federated learning, on-device processing) with ability to engage credibly with researchers and engineers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are skilled at stakeholder management across government, industry, academia, and civil society, with a track record of building productive relationships with regulators and policymakers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have proven ability to drive cross-functional initiatives and influence decisions across legal, product, and research organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are comfortable with ambiguity and can set strategic direction when frameworks don't yet exist</p>
</li>

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate.

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
