<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the Role:</h2>
<p>Anthropic is seeking an Education Platform Engineering Lead to help build the technical foundation for how Anthropic educates customers and enterprises at scale, and to shape what that even means when AI is the delivery mechanism, not just the subject being taught.</p>
<p>Your work will define how millions of people experience learning about Claude: how content is served and adapted in real time, how assessments respond to what a learner actually understands, how credentialing systems verify genuine competence rather than course completion, and how the entire platform evolves as fast as the product it teaches. You'll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day.</p>
<p>You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You'll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you'll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger.</p>
<p>This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You'll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else's spec. You'll interface closely with Anthropic's security, infrastructure, and data teams, and you'll partner with trainers and educators on the GTM, devrel, and education teams who will be your primary stakeholders.</p>
<h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Architect and own Anthropic’s enterprise ready education platform and infrastructure — authentication/SSO, learner data models, content delivery, credentialing, and progress tracking — designed for scale, AI-forward features, and reliability from day one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Own the technical vision for how Anthropic delivers AI-driven educational experiences and shaping what's possible, not just building what's requested. You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface with Anthropic's security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you're shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you'll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate</p>
</li>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
