<li>Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact</li>
<li>Thrive in a fast-paced research environment where you balance rigorous scientific standards with rapid iteration</li>
<li>Are passionate about using AI to accelerate scientific discovery while maintaining high ethical standards</li>
<li>Have experience managing data pipelines and working with large-scale biological datasets</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ph.D. in a biological science (molecular biology, biochemistry, computational biology), in Machine Learning, or in a related field, or equivalent industry experience</li>
<li>Published research or practical experience in scientific AI applications or long-horizon reasoning</li>
<li>A history working on Reinforcement Learning and/or Pretraining</li>
<li>Knowledge of containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) and cloud deployment at scale</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to work across multiple domains (language modeling, systems engineering, scientific computing)</li>
<li>Experience with modern machine learning techniques and model training methodologies</li>
<li>Familiarity with biological databases (UniProt, GenBank, PDB) and computational biology tools</li>
<li>Experience in drug discovery, including computational chemistry or structure-based design</li>
<li>Knowledge of regulatory requirements for therapeutic development or clinical research</li>
<li>Contributions to open-source scientific software or databases</li>
</ul>
<p>This role offers a unique opportunity to shape how AI transforms biological research. You'll work with some of the world's best AI researchers while tackling problems that matter deeply for human health and scientific understanding. If you're excited about using your expertise to guide the development of transformative AI systems, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>Deadline to apply:&nbsp;</strong>None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is below.

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
