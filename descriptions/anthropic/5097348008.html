<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>AI-Driven Enablement / Full-Time / US Offices</strong></h2><p>Anthropic is seeking a Certification Content and Systems Architect to design and build the educational content and assessment components that power Anthropic's credentialing efforts. You'll own the substance of what certifications teach and measure: curriculum architecture, assessment design, competency frameworks, and the AI-native systems that let one educator maintain and evolve certification content across multiple programs simultaneously.</p><p>You'll work closely with go-to-market and partnerships teams who define what certifications are needed and for whom. You own the educational design: what people need to know, how we assess whether they know it, and how we build those learning and assessment experiences to scale through intelligent tooling rather than growing headcount. The broader program strategy — audience planning, pricing, partner relationships — lives with other teams; you're the person who makes the education rigorous, current, and scalable.</p><p>We're looking for someone who thinks about assessment from first principles — someone skeptical of multiple-choice exams as the default and excited about what becomes possible when AI can evaluate demonstrations of competence, generate adaptive assessments, and maintain item banks that evolve with the product. You should be as comfortable building the tooling and workflows around certification as you are designing the educational content itself.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Design certification curriculum architectures, assessment methodologies, and competency frameworks for product and technical knowledge</p></li><li><p>Build AI-augmented assessment systems — item generation, adaptive testing, competency evaluation — that maintain rigor while scaling without proportional human effort</p></li><li><p>Define competency levels, learning progressions, and assessment rubrics for different certification tiers as defined by program stakeholders</p></li><li><p>Create and maintain the educational content that feeds into certification programs, working with the Train-the-Trainer Lead to ensure alignment between training delivery and credentialing requirements</p></li><li><p>Develop and maintain item banks, assessment instruments, and evaluation rubrics — and build AI-assisted processes for keeping these current as Claude's capabilities evolve</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with GTM, Partnerships, and Customer Success when they identify certification needs — receiving their requirements around audience and business context, then owning the educational design and delivery</p></li><li><p>Establish quality standards for certification assessments including validity, reliability, and fairness</p></li><li><p>Analyze assessment data to continuously improve the learning experience and identify gaps in educational content</p></li><li><p>Build operational tooling for certification administration, verification, and renewal on the educational side</p></li></ul><p><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></p><ul><li><p>5+ years in education, assessment design, credentialing, or developer education — with demonstrated experience designing how competence is measured, not just how content is delivered</p></li><li><p>A working practice of using AI tools as core infrastructure in your workflows — you naturally build AI into your processes for content generation, assessment creation, quality checking, and operational tasks</p></li><li><p>Technical fluency with Claude's products including the API, Claude Code, and <a target="_blank" class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Claude.ai">Claude.ai</a> — sufficient to design meaningful assessments of real competence with these tools</p></li><li><p>Experience with assessment methodologies beyond multiple-choice: performance-based assessment, portfolio evaluation, adaptive testing, or other approaches that measure applied skill</p></li><li><p>Strong educational design instincts — you think in terms of learning progressions, competency frameworks, and what it actually means to "know" something versus having been exposed to it</p></li><li><p>Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments and building from scratch — particularly building systems designed to run lean through intelligent automation</p></li><li><p>Clear, structured communication and the ability to work with non-education stakeholders (sales, partnerships) while maintaining an educator's standards</p></li></ul><p><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Experience building AI-augmented assessment systems or using LLMs for item generation, evaluation, or adaptive learning</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of psychometrics, credential validation, or assessment quality frameworks</p></li><li><p>Experience with non-traditional methods for tracking and assessing understanding</p></li><li><p>Background in developer education or technical credentialing specifically</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with LMS platforms or certification delivery systems</p></li><li><p>Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change</p></li></ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
