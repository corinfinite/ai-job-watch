<p>Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We aim to make AI safe and beneficial for our customers and society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team brings expertise from ML, physics, policy, business, and product development.</p>
<h2><strong>About the Role&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>As a Technical Program Manager for Inference, you'll be the critical bridge between our inference systems and the broader organization. You'll drive strategic initiatives around inference infrastructure adoption, capacity management, and deployment processes while ensuring seamless coordination across research, engineering, and product teams. This role is essential for scaling our inference infrastructure to meet growing demand while maintaining operational excellence.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systems Integration &amp; Coordination</strong>: Lead cross-functional initiatives for new infrastructure integration, establishing clear ownership, timelines, and communication channels between teams. Drive end-to-end planning for major infrastructure transitions including platform modernization and new tech adoption.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Capacity Management:</strong> Develop and maintain processes for inference capacity planning and optimization. Partner with engineering teams to track utilization metrics, identify bottlenecks, and coordinate with capacity teams on resource allocation and model deprecation strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Excellence:</strong> Establish and enforce governance for deployment processes, defining clear policies for self-service versus managed deployments. Create and maintain service level agreements for different deployment types and ensure smooth launches across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Own and prioritize the inference deployment roadmap, working closely with engineering leadership to prioritize initiatives and manage dependencies. Provide visibility into upcoming changes and their organizational impact.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Communication:</strong> Build strong relationships across research, engineering, and product teams to understand requirements and constraints. Translate technical complexities into clear updates for leadership and ensure alignment on priorities and timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Identify inefficiencies in current workflows and drive systematic improvements. Establish metrics and dashboards to track infrastructure health, capacity utilization, and deployment success rates.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have several years of experience in technical program management, with proven success delivering complex infrastructure programs, preferably in ML/AI systems or large-scale distributed systems</li>
<li>Have deep technical understanding of inference systems, or cloud infrastructure - enough to engage substantively with engineers and identify technical risks</li>
<li>Excel at creating structure and processes in ambiguous environments, bringing clarity to complex cross-team initiatives</li>
<li>Have strong stakeholder management skills and can build trust with both technical and non-technical partners</li>
<li>Are comfortable navigating competing priorities and using data to drive technical decisions</li>
<li>Have experience with infrastructure scaling initiatives, hardware integrations, or deployment governance</li>
<li>Thrive in fast-paced environments and can balance strategic planning with tactical execution</li>
<li>Are passionate about AI infrastructure and understand the unique challenges of deploying and scaling large language models</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
