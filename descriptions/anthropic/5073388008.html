<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>We are seeking a pragmatic generalist to help grow capacity for our ongoing efforts to execute on (as well as improve) Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our RSP is a series of technical and organizational protocols that we have adopted to help us manage the risks of developing increasingly capable AI systems. Among other things, it involves maintaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward-looking plans</strong> for improving risk mitigation across the areas of Security, Alignment, and Safeguards. To maintain these plans, we work with stakeholders from across the company to set and iterate on ambitious but achievable goals, regularly check in on whether we’re on track to meet the goals, and problem-solve as needed to fulfill their spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing assessments</strong> of how well we are executing on the vision of our RSP —especially the extent to which our AI systems may or may not pose catastrophic risks, in light of their capabilities as well as our risk mitigations. We monitor developments in our AIs’ capabilities, and changes in our risk mitigations, to keep these up to date and ensure that any adjustments to our operational practices are made deliberately and thoughtfully.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the company grows and AI capabilities improve, executing on our RSP is becoming increasingly important, complex, and cross-functional. Our RSP team works to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set and check in on forward-looking goals for improving risk mitigations.</li>
<li>Check in on activity across the company to ensure that our activities and risk mitigations are in line with the RSP.</li>
<li>Partner with the Security, Alignment, and Safeguards teams to develop practical and effective risk mitigation strategies.</li>
<li>Propose RSP revisions to reflect what we’re learning.</li>
<li>Collaborate with our Policy team when the RSP is relevant to regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This role offers a unique opportunity to work on the nuts and bolts of AI risk reduction, interacting with many different parts of the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success in this role means learning quickly about many aspects of our business; combining this with a deep understanding of the major catastrophic risks potentially posed by advanced AI; and bringing a pragmatic problem-solving attitude, constantly looking for the best and most practical ways to achieve risk reduction.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>In this role, you will:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Build relationships with internal experts on Safeguards, Security, Alignment, capability evaluations, and other relevant areas.</li>
<li>Learn about ongoing questions and challenges faced by these teams, and help to find the best balance between AI risk reduction and pragmatism.</li>
<li>Gather information from across the company and assist in analyzing relevant risks.</li>
<li>Help to drive conversations about the ambitious-but-achievable plans we can make to level up our risk mitigations.</li>
<li>Collaborate with our Policy team, advising on regulation relevant to RSPs.</li>
<li>Generally work to identify the most promising risk mitigations to be further developed and/or exported to the rest of the AI industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have (or can quickly develop) a deep understanding of major catastrophic risks potentially posed by advanced AI.</li>
<li>Are passionate about reducing the harms and improving the benefits of AI&nbsp; and align with Anthropic's safety mission and commitment to responsible AI development</li>
<li>Are a pragmatic problem-solver who relishes the opportunity to find the best balance between the goal of reducing catastrophic risks and staying on the frontier of AI development.</li>
<li>Can write quickly and clearly in a way that gives audiences an easy time understanding your reasoning and justifications for your claims</li>
<li>Are a flexible generalist who is excited to learn about many topics and evolve your work in unanticipated directions as we contend with a rapidly changing AI landscape</li>
<li>Are highly organized and excel at managing multiple projects simultaneously, maintaining clear priorities and delivering on tight timelines</li>
<li>Are comfortable operating in ambiguous environments, taking ownership of problems, and proactively driving initiatives with limited precedent</li>
<li>Are scrappy and hard-working, but also humble, genuinely collaborative, and a strong team player</li>
<li>Hold at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field</li>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
