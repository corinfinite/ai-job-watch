<li>Building the EMEA Industries marketing function from scratch—defining account tiering criteria, campaign architecture, and sales partnership rhythms for a new region</li>
<li>Designing and executing a multi-touch ABM program for Tier 1 accounts across industries like Financial Services and Retail, moving deals from champion-level engagement to executive sponsorship</li>
<li>Creating a competitive narrative for EMEA industries that addresses competitor comparisons and internal build-vs-buy discussions across different verticals</li>
<li>Establishing a measurement framework and reporting cadence that demonstrates marketing's impact on pipeline and deal velocity to sales leadership</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
