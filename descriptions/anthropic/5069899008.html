<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>The Global Partner Sales Manager for Systems Integrators will serve as the strategic architect and executive owner of Anthropic's relationships with up to three tier-one global systems integrators. This role demands a seasoned enterprise partnership sales manager who can orchestrate multiple complex, multi-dimensional global relationships simultaneously, spanning co-selling, channel enablement, solution development, and joint go-to-market execution across each partner. The successful candidate will be accountable for transforming these GSI partners into billion-dollar Claude revenue engines, nurturing their growth from initial enablement through to scaled, industry-specific practices that deliver transformative customer solutions powered by Claude.<br><br></p>
<p>This is a high-stakes, execution-focused role requiring someone who can operate at the C-suite level with multiple GSI partners' global leadership while simultaneously driving tactical wins across priority markets and industry verticals. You will own the strategic roadmap, investment prioritization, development plans, and revenue accountability for a portfolio of partnerships that will collectively become critical drivers of Anthropic's enterprise growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Multi-Partner Portfolio Management</strong></p>
<p>You will own and orchestrate the complete 360-degree relationship with up to three major systems integrators across all dimensions: sell-to (partners as customers), sell-with (joint selling to enterprise accounts), and sell-through (partner-led channel sales). This requires balancing investment across your partner portfolio, determining which partners lead in which industries and geographies, and architecting each partnership for maximum mutual value creation. You will be personally accountable for the aggregate contribution of your partner portfolio and responsible for establishing the metrics, governance, and strategic frameworks that ensure all partners are progressing toward their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Development and Practice Building</strong></p>
<p>You will nurture each partner from early-stage enablement through to mature, scaled practices capable of delivering comprehensive industry and segment-specific solutions. This means working with partner leadership to define practice vision and architecture, co-developing go-to-market strategies by industry vertical, and establishing the organizational structures, talent models, and solution portfolios that enable each partner to build expansive global Anthropic practices. You will guide partners in creating repeatable customer solutions that address specific use cases across industries including financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, public sector, and professional services.</p>
<p><strong>Training, Enablement and Certification</strong></p>
<p>You will design and oversee comprehensive enablement programs that transform your partners' workforces into Claude experts and advocates. This includes building training curricula spanning technical implementation, solution architecture, industry applications, and business value articulation. You will establish certification programs that create tiers of expertise within each partner organization, develop enablement materials that scale globally, and ensure partners understand competitive differentiation and can confidently position Claude against alternative AI platforms. Success means creating thousands of enabled professionals across your partner portfolio who can design, build, and deliver production-grade agentic solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Industry and Segment Solution Development</strong></p>
<p>You will collaborate with each partner to build declarative, production-grade solutions powered by Claude that address specific industry challenges and segment use cases. This means partnering with their industry practices to identify high-value use cases, co-developing reference architectures and solution accelerators, and ensuring each partner builds a differentiated solution portfolio that showcases Claude's unique capabilities. You will drive the creation of industry-specific offerings spanning areas such as intelligent document processing, customer service transformation, software development acceleration, research and analysis automation, regulatory compliance, and decision support systems.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Generation and Market Leadership</strong></p>
<p>You will lead the pursuit and closure of market-tipping deals across your partner portfolio that establish Claude as the enterprise standard for agentic AI. This means building executive relationships within each partner's C-suite, identifying and influencing their largest transformation opportunities, and ensuring Claude is positioned as the foundational technology for their agentic enterprise vision. A primary measure of success will be the velocity at which each partner builds a billion-dollar Claude practice, with clear milestones and accountability mechanisms you establish and drive across your portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Success and Lifetime Value</strong></p>
<p>Every deal influenced through your partner portfolio must be architected for customer success and long-term value expansion. You will establish success criteria for joint accounts, ensure proper implementation and adoption support, and create feedback loops that drive continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>GSI Partnership Expertise</strong></p>
<p>You have 8+ years of direct experience managing strategic partnerships with tier-one systems integrators. You possess the ability to nurture or have existing VP+ level relationships across multiple GSIs and understand how to navigate their complex organizational matrices. You have previously owned partnership portfolios generating $250M+ in aggregate influenced or direct revenue and have experience balancing investment and prioritization across multiple strategic partners simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Development and Practice Building</strong></p>
<p>You have successfully nurtured partners from early stages through to scaled practices, understanding the developmental journey from initial enablement to mature, revenue-generating organizations. You know how to build partner business plans, establish practice architectures, develop enablement programs at scale, and measure partner maturity and progression. You have experience helping partners build industry-specific and use-case-driven solutions that create repeatable revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Platform Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>You have built partnerships in high-growth technology categories (cloud platforms, enterprise software, AI/ML) where partner enablement, competitive positioning, technical differentiation, and solution development were critical success factors. You understand how to translate technical capabilities into business value propositions that resonate with enterprise buyers and partner sales organizations across diverse industry verticals.</p>
<p><strong>Global Operating Model and Portfolio Management</strong></p>
<p>You have operated successfully in partner roles requiring coordination across multiple geographies, cultures, and time zones while simultaneously managing multiple strategic partner relationships. You understand how to establish global frameworks while enabling regional execution, prioritize investment across a partner portfolio based on strategic value and maturity, and build virtual teams that span partner and internal resources across continents.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Accountability and Commercial Acumen</strong></p>
<p>You have carried revenue targets in previous roles with forecasting, and the financial mechanics of channel partnerships. You are comfortable with ambitious growth targets across a portfolio and know how to build bottoms-up models that connect activity to revenue outcomes. You understand how to balance short-term revenue delivery with long-term partner development and investment.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Success Profile:</strong></h2>
<p>The ideal candidate combines strategic vision with relentless execution discipline and the organizational capability to manage multiple complex partnerships simultaneously. You are equally comfortable presenting Anthropic's strategic vision to a GSI's Global CEO as you are rolling up your sleeves to rescue a stuck deal or workshop an industry solution with a partner's practice team. You have the gravitas to influence senior executives across multiple organizations while maintaining the hunger and urgency of a quota-carrying seller.</p>
<p>You are obsessively competitive and bring deep conviction about how to win in the market across diverse industries and use cases. You understand the AI landscape, can articulate Claude's technical and philosophical differentiation, and have the credibility to challenge partners when they're not positioning us effectively. You are energized by building and nurturing, understanding that creating multiple billion-dollar partnerships requires both visionary thinking and daily operational excellence across your portfolio.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
