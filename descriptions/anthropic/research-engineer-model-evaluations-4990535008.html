<li>Partner with research teams to develop domain-specific evaluations that probe for emerging capabilities and potential risks</li>
<li>Build infrastructure to enable rapid iteration on evaluation design, supporting both automated and human-in-the-loop assessment approaches</li>
<li>Establish best practices and standards for evaluation development across the organization</li>
<li>Mentor team members and contribute to the growth of evaluation expertise at Anthropic</li>
<li>Coordinate evaluation efforts during critical training runs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and timely results</li>
<li>Contribute to research publications and external communications about evaluation methodologies and findings</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have experience designing and implementing evaluation systems for machine learning models, particularly large language models</li>
<li>Have demonstrated technical leadership experience, either formally or through leading complex technical projects</li>
<li>Are skilled at both systems engineering and experimental design, comfortable building infrastructure while maintaining scientific rigor</li>
<li>Have strong programming skills in Python and experience with distributed computing frameworks</li>
<li>Can translate between research needs and engineering constraints, finding pragmatic solutions to complex problems</li>
<li>Are results-oriented and thrive in fast-paced environments where priorities can shift based on research findings</li>
<li>Enjoy collaborative work and can effectively communicate technical concepts to diverse stakeholders</li>
<li>Care deeply about AI safety and the societal impacts of the systems we build</li>
<li>Have experience with statistical analysis and can draw meaningful conclusions from large-scale experimental data</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience with evaluation during model training, particularly in production environments</li>
<li>Familiarity with safety evaluation frameworks and red teaming methodologies</li>
<li>Background in psychometrics, experimental psychology, or other fields focused on measurement and assessment</li>
<li>Experience with reinforcement learning evaluation or multi-agent systems</li>
<li>Contributions to open-source evaluation benchmarks or frameworks</li>
<li>Knowledge of prompt engineering and its role in evaluation design</li>
<li>Experience managing evaluation infrastructure at scale (thousands of experiments)</li>
<li>Published research in machine learning evaluation, benchmarking, or related areas</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Representative projects</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Designing comprehensive evaluation suites that assess models across hundreds of capability dimensions</li>
<li>Building real-time evaluation dashboards that surface critical insights during multi-week training runs</li>
<li>Developing novel evaluation approaches for emerging capabilities like multi-step reasoning or tool use</li>
<li>Creating automated systems to detect regression in model performance or safety properties</li>
<li>Implementing efficient evaluation sampling strategies that balance coverage with computational constraints</li>
<li>Collaborating with external partners to develop industry-standard evaluation benchmarks</li>
<li>Building infrastructure to support human evaluation at scale, including quality control and aggregation systems&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
