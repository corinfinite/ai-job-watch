<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role:</strong></h2>
<p>As a Support Operations Analyst, you will build the analytical and workforce planning foundation that enables Anthropic's support organization to scale intelligently. This role sits at the intersection of data analysis, capacity planning, and operational strategy—providing the insights leadership needs to make confident decisions about staffing, investment, and service levels.</p>
<p>You'll own forecasting and capacity planning across our support organization, including FTE teams, AI-powered support channels, and vendor/contractor partnerships. This means building models that predict volume based on product launches, model releases, and customer growth; analyzing the relationship between support metrics and business outcomes; and ensuring we have the right resources in the right places to meet our service commitments.</p>
<p>This is a high-ambiguity role where you'll often be building from scratch. We're looking for someone who can create structure where none exists, ask the right questions to scope problems, and translate messy data into narratives that drive action.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Workforce Planning &amp; Forecasting</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build and maintain staffing models that translate SLA targets into headcount requirements across FTE and vendor teams</li>
<li>Forecast support volume by analyzing historical trends, product release calendars, model launches, and customer base growth projections</li>
<li>Factor AI support effectiveness (automation rates, deflection, Fin AI Agent performance) into capacity models to ensure accurate human staffing projections</li>
<li>Partner with vendor managers to align contractor capacity with demand forecasts and service level requirements</li>
<li>Model scenarios to inform strategic decisions about staffing investments, vendor mix, and coverage models</li>
<li>Develop frameworks for prioritizing automation initiatives based on volume impact and deflection potential</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Analytics &amp; Reporting</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain and enhance dashboards that track productivity, response times, CSAT, queue health, and other key support metrics</li>
<li>Investigate the relationship between support performance and business outcomes (e.g., how response time and satisfaction impact retention and churn)</li>
<li>Surface trends and insights that inform operational decisions—identifying what's driving volume, where bottlenecks emerge, and where investment is needed</li>
<li>Translate complex data into clear recommendations for leadership and cross-functional partners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Operational Partnership</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborate with Support Ops, AI Support, and Human Support teams to ensure data and forecasts align with operational reality</li>
<li>Partner with Finance on headcount planning, budget alignment, and quarterly capacity reviews</li>
<li>Work with Product and Engineering to anticipate how launches and feature changes will impact support demand</li>
<li>Contribute to vendor performance management by establishing metrics frameworks and reporting cadences</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You might be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 4+ years of experience in workforce management, support operations analytics, business analytics, or similar roles—ideally in a support or customer success context</li>
<li>Are deeply analytical with strong SQL skills and experience with data warehouses (e.g., BigQuery) and analysis tools like Hex, Looker, or similar</li>
<li>Have hands-on experience with forecasting and capacity planning, including modeling staffing needs against service level targets</li>
<li>Are comfortable working with ambiguity—you can take a vague question, scope it into an answerable problem, and deliver insights that drive decisions</li>
<li>Understand support operations metrics (SLAs, handle time, CSAT, deflection rates) and can connect them to business impact</li>
<li>Have experience working with BPO or vendor partners on staffing, performance, and capacity alignment</li>
<li>Communicate clearly—you can translate technical analysis into narratives that resonate with both operational teams and executives</li>
<li>Are curious about AI and excited to work in an environment where the product and support landscape evolve rapidly</li>
<li>Thrive in fast-paced environments and can balance building foundational infrastructure with responding to urgent business questions</li>
<li>Have experience with workforce management platforms (e.g., Assembled, NICE, Calabrio) is a plus, but not required</li>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
