<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5">About the Role</h2>
<p>We are looking for Engineering Managers to join our Claude Experiences org to lead and grow teams of software engineers working on backend systems for <a href="http://claude.ai">Claude.ai</a>, including our clients on the web, desktop, and mobile. You'll be responsible for defining and executing the creation of shared product capabilities at the core of Claude.ai while maintaining clear direction and stability for your team.</p>
<p>This is a net-new team, initially seeded with a small number of tenured Claude.ai engineers. Historically, the design, development, and maintenance of our systems and infrastructure was a shared responsibility between our small group of Claude Experiences engineers, collaborating closely with our larger Platform and Infra organizations. We believe that there is an opportunity for a team to drive a lot of impact, both in our foundations and in the product, by focusing on backend systems specifically for Claude.ai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll partner closely with product managers, engineering leadership, research teams, and our inference, infrastructure, and platform teams to transform emerging AI capabilities into products that make AI collaboration feel effortless, pro-human, and essential to how work gets done.</p>
<p>Success in this role requires a strong ability to understand stakeholder needs, identify opportunities to share capabilities across products, understand our product and roadmap deeply, and the ability to facilitate rapid iterations to improve our product suite. We both need to maintain high-quality systems for our existing product surfaces while collaborating closely with research to build products at the frontier of model capabilities.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
