<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role:</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager for Model Behaviors, you will partner with the Alignment Finetuning team to define and shape Claude's character, behaviors, and reinforcement signals—work that directly influences how millions of people experience AI. You will systematically identify high-priority behavioral improvements, coordinate across Research, Product, and Safeguards teams, and accelerate our ability to ship well-aligned models. The ideal candidate combines deep user empathy with the judgment to navigate nuanced behavior questions where there are no clear right answers.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define behavioral defaults and steerability constraints&nbsp;</li>
<li>Develop and maintain taxonomies of model behaviors across capabilities</li>
<li>Identify, triage, and prioritize behavior issues and opportunities, coordinating input from Users, Research, Product, and Safeguards teams</li>
<li>Amplify alignment research breakthroughs, translating them into product, process, and model improvements</li>
<li>Deeply understand user interaction patterns to identify behavior improvements that make Claude more helpful and safe</li>
<li>Contribute to evals that measure alignment progress</li>
<li>Identify and scale initiatives and tools that help researchers ship alignment improvements faster</li>
</ul>

<li>Have strong user empathy and the ability to synthesize vague or contradictory feedback into actionable priorities</li>
<li>Have strong judgment and model taste, with the ability to make tradeoffs when there is no clear right answer</li>
<li>Have a strong grasp of ML concepts and are willing to go deep on technical solutions&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have intellectual curiosity without ego—comfortable asking questions and learning independently</li>
<li>Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, moving beyond past checklists and playbooks</li>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
