<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><p><strong data-stringify-type="bold"><a href="https://constellation.fillout.com/anthropicfellows">Apply&nbsp;using this link</a>.</strong><strong data-stringify-type="bold">&nbsp;We’re accepting applications on a rolling basis for cohorts starting in July 2026 and beyond. Applications for the May 2026 cohort are now closed.</strong></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Anthropic Fellows Program Overview</strong></span></h1>
<p>The Anthropic Fellows Program is designed to accelerate AI safety research and foster research talent. We provide funding and mentorship to promising technical talent - regardless of previous experience - to research the frontier of AI safety for four months.</p>
<p>Fellows will primarily use external infrastructure (e.g. open-source models, public APIs) to work on an empirical project aligned with our research priorities, with the goal of producing a <strong>public output</strong> (e.g. a paper submission). In our previous cohorts, over 80% of fellows produced papers (more below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We run multiple cohorts of Fellows each year. This application is for cohorts starting in July 2026 and beyond.</p>

<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></span></h1>
<ul>
<li>Are motivated by reducing catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems</li>
<li>Are excited to transition into full-time empirical AI safety research and would be interested in a full-time role at Anthropic</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><strong>Please note:</strong> We do not guarantee that we will make any full-time offers to fellows. However, strong performance during the program may indicate that a Fellow would be a good fit here at Anthropic. In previous cohorts, over 40% of fellows received a full-time offer, and we’ve supported many more to go on to do great work on safety at other organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a strong technical background in computer science, mathematics, physics, cybersecurity, or related fields</li>
<li>Thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments</li>
<li>Can implement ideas quickly and communicate clearly</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience with empirical ML research projects</li>
<li>Experience working with Large Language Models</li>
<li>Experience in one of the research areas mentioned above</li>
<li>Experience with deep learning frameworks and experiment management</li>
<li>Track record of open-source contributions</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Candidates must be:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fluent in Python programming</li>
<li>Available to work full-time on the Fellows program for 4 months</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Interview process</strong></span></h1>
<p>The interview process will include an initial application &amp; references check, technical assessments &amp; interviews, and a research discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
