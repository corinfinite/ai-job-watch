<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for a Program Manager to grow our <a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/ai-for-science-program" target="_blank"><u>AI for Science Program</u></a>. You'll build and manage partnerships with individual labs from around the world. This program is the primary way that Anthropic’s life sciences efforts works with individual labs that have new and innovative ideas for how Claude can contribute to a growing set of scientific domains.</p>
<p>This is a foundational role where you'll shape our strategy for deploying Claude for Life Sciences across domains of research including the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and materials science. You'll work with incredibly interdisciplinary partners from academia as well as early stage companies. Your goal will be to develop relationships and goal directed partnerships that demonstrate or expand the capabilities of Claude in the sciences. You will focus both on individual projects but also building communities of practice that bring together scientists with similar interests or objectives. The right person will combine deep relationships in sciences with an entrepreneurial and experimental drive to build something new at the frontier of AI.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>About Beneficial Deployments</strong></h2>
<p>Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences. We prioritize opportunities to make AI more accessible and raise the floor of what is possible in a given domain while also partnering with leaders to help expand the use of AI to new tasks that raise the ceiling of what is possible.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
