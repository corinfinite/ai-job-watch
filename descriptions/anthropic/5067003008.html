<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking for a Technical Scaled Abuse Threat Investigator to join our Threat Intelligence team. In this role, you will be responsible for detecting, investigating, and disrupting large-scale misuse of Anthropic's AI systems, including model distillation, account abuse, fraud, scams, and other forms of scaled exploitation.</p>
<p>You will combine open-source research with analysis of internal data to understand how sophisticated adversaries gain access to Anthropic systems and conduct abuse at scale. Your work will directly inform our defenses against threat actors who seek to exploit our products for financial gain, competitive advantage, or to cause widespread harm.</p>
<p>Important context: In this position you may be exposed to explicit content spanning a range of topics, including those of a sexual, violent, or psychologically disturbing nature. This role may require responding to escalations during weekends and holidays.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Detect and investigate large-scale abuse patterns including model distillation, unauthorized API access, account farming, fraud schemes, and scam operations</li>
<li>Develop abuse signals and tracking strategies to proactively identify scaled adversarial activity and coordinated abuse networks</li>
<li>Conduct technical investigations using SQL, Python, and data science methodologies to analyze large datasets and uncover sophisticated abuse patterns</li>
<li>Create actionable intelligence reports on new attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and threat actor TTPs targeting AI systems at scale</li>
<li>Utilize investigation findings to implement systematic improvements to our safety approach and mitigate harm</li>
<li>Study trends internally and in the broader ecosystem to anticipate how AI systems could be exploited, generating and publishing reports</li>
<li>Build and maintain relationships with external threat intelligence partners and information sharing communities</li>
<li>Work cross-functionally to build out our threat intelligence program, establishing processes, tools, and best practices</li>
<li>Forecast how abuse actors will leverage advances in AI technology and inform safety-by-design strategies</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have strong proficiency in SQL and Python with a data science background</li>
<li>Have experience with large language models and understanding of how AI technology could be exploited at scale</li>
<li>Have subject matter expertise in abusive user behavior detection, fraud patterns, account abuse, or platform integrity</li>
<li>Have experience tracking threat actors across surface, deep, and dark web environments</li>
<li>Can derive insights from large datasets to make key decisions and recommendations</li>
<li>Have experience with threat actor profiling and utilizing threat intelligence frameworks</li>
<li>Have strong project management skills and ability to build processes from the ground up</li>
<li>Possess excellent communication skills to collaborate with cross-functional teams and present to leadership</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience at a major technology platform working on trust and safety, fraud, or abuse investigations</li>
<li>Background in AI safety, machine learning security, or technology abuse investigation</li>
<li>Experience building and scaling threat detection systems or abuse monitoring programs</li>
<li>Experience with financial crime investigation or fraud analytics</li>
<li>Fluency in Mandarin Chinese and/or Russian (speaking, reading, and writing) combined with a nuanced understanding of the geopolitical landscape and cultural context of the respective regions.</li>
<li>Active Top Secret security clearance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
