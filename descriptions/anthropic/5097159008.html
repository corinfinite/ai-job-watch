<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As a Business Systems Analyst - Security Workforce on Anthropic's BizTech team, you'll own and evolve how Anthropic manages contractor security, access governance, and technical onboarding. This role sits at the intersection of security operations, workforce management, and employee experience—ensuring that everyone who joins Anthropic, whether as a contractor or full-time employee, has the access they need to do meaningful work while maintaining the security posture our mission demands.</p>
<p>You'll build and run the programs that govern how contingent workers are onboarded, credentialed, and offboarded from a security and access perspective. You'll also own the technical onboarding experience for our engineering and research roles, creating a seamless first-week experience that sets people up for success. This is a role for someone who believes that security and great user experience aren't at odds—they're complementary.</p>
<p>As Anthropic continues to scale rapidly, you'll help ensure our contingent workforce programs and onboarding processes evolve to meet the growing demands of our organization while maintaining the high standards of security, compliance, and experience that Anthropic requires.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
