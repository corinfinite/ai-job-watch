<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Technical Program Manager for Enterprise Readiness, you will define and execute the cross-functional programs that systematically eliminate enterprise adoption barriers and accelerate adoption for Anthropic’s largest customers. You will lead strategic initiatives spanning product readiness, operational maturity, security and compliance, and GTM enablement that are essential to Anthropic’s ability to win and retain enterprise business at scale.</p>
<p>This is a very senior TPM role requiring executive presence, strategic vision, and the ability to drive transformational programs across Product, Engineering, Security, Legal, Finance, and Go-to-Market teams. You will be responsible for building the programmatic foundations of Anthropic’s enterprise operating model—driving accountability across a comprehensive Enterprise Readiness scorecard, coordinating steering committee cadences, and ensuring that DRIs across the company are executing against shared enterprise goals.</p>
<p>This role demands someone who can navigate ambiguity across multiple organizations, drive alignment among senior leaders with competing priorities, and translate complex enterprise requirements into actionable programs with clear milestones.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Own the Enterprise Readiness program end-to-end</strong> — Define and drive the strategy, roadmap, and execution of cross-functional initiatives that close enterprise product, operational, and GTM gaps. Maintain and evolve the Enterprise Readiness scorecard across all dimensions (Security &amp; Compliance, Platform Reliability, Admin Controls, Data Governance, Support Operations, Billing, and more)</li>
<li><strong>Translate top customer asks into executable programs</strong> — Partner with GTM to prioritize the highest-impact customer requests and map them to product roadmaps with clear delivery timelines</li>
<li><strong>Drive competitive parity analysis and roadmap prioritization</strong> — Work backwards from competitor capabilities to identify gaps, build roadmaps, and ensure leadership has visibility into where we stand vs. the market</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate complex multi-team initiatives</strong> — Manage programs that span Product, Engineering, Security, Legal, Finance, and GTM, requiring careful sequencing, dependency management, and organizational change</li>
<li><strong>Drive deal cycle efficiency</strong> — Partner with GTM to audit and streamline processes that slow enterprise deal velocity—from vendor onboarding questionnaires to contract redlines</li>
<li><strong>Stand up Enterprise Support capabilities</strong> — Coordinate the launch of premium support tiers with 24/7 coverage, contracted SLAs, and new support channels</li>
<li><strong>Lead stakeholder communication and executive reporting</strong> — Prepare regular status updates, communicate program health to leadership, and escalate blockers that require executive decision-making</li>
<li><strong>Build program structure for emerging enterprise requirements</strong> — Create program charters, establish roles and timelines, develop communication strategies, and define success metrics for nascent initiatives identified through customer feedback or competitive analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>You may be a good fit if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Have 10+ years of experience in technical program management, with a track record of successfully delivering complex, cross-functional programs that span multiple organizations</li>
<li>Have experience driving enterprise readiness, go-to-market operations, or platform/infrastructure programs at a high-growth company</li>
<li>Possess deep understanding of enterprise requirements including security frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP), compliance certifications (HIPAA, GDPR), and platform capabilities (SSO, SCIM, CMEK, data residency)</li>
<li>Excel at translating between technical teams, product leadership, and GTM stakeholders, making complex tradeoffs understandable across audiences</li>
<li>Have experience managing programs that require organizational change and "working through others" rather than direct authority</li>
<li>Can thrive in ambiguous situations, bringing structure to complex challenges with competing priorities and limited resources</li>
<li>Have strong organizational skills and can manage multiple parallel workstreams effectively across distributed teams</li>
<li>Have a data-driven approach to program management, using metrics and scorecards to measure progress and drive accountability</li>
<li>Are comfortable operating at a fast pace where priorities shift based on customer feedback and competitive dynamics</li>
<li>Have excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to influence without authority and drive alignment among senior leaders</li>
<li>Are passionate about Anthropic's mission and interested in the challenges of bringing frontier AI capabilities to enterprise customers safely</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
