<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>We're looking for a [Partnership/Program] Manager to lead our partnerships with US based research institutions. You'll build partnerships that look to bring Claude for Life Sciences to research institutions as a mechanism by which institutions can advance toward shared goals while enabling their researchers to engage in less structured experimentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a foundational role where you'll shape our strategy and implementation of enterprise deployments tackling some of the most ambitious and challenging questions in science. You'll work with incredibly interdisciplinary institutions and be responsible for immersing yourself in their science, regularly spending time onsite, and helping our Research and Applied AI team understand key bottlenecks and opportunities. Your goal will be to develop relationships and goal directed partnerships that demonstrate or expand the capabilities of Claude in the sciences. You will be responsible for coordinating regular training and education as well as more strategic institutional initiatives. The right person will combine broad expertise and interest in science, a desire to be close to scientists and the lab, and an entrepreneurial and experimental drive to co-develop solutions with them that advance the frontier of AI.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>About Beneficial Deployments</strong></h2>
<p>Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences. We prioritize opportunities to make AI more accessible and raise the floor of what is possible in a given domain while also partnering with leaders in a given domain to expand the use of AI to new tasks that raise the ceiling of what is possible.</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
