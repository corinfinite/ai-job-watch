<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Research Engineer / Scientist on the Societal Impacts team, you'll design and build critical infrastructure that enables and accelerates foundational research into how our AI systems impact people and society. Your work will directly contribute to our research publications, policy campaigns, safety systems, and products.<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fa8GDWvbOE3HISHGda-thXgIEnaWmae9mMLHrxKgQWs/edit?usp=sharing">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/societal-impacts">Our team</a> combines rigorous empirical methods with creative technical approaches. We’re currently grappling with big questions on how AI might impact the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic">future of work</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-people-use-claude-for-support-advice-and-companionship">people's wellbeing</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-education-report-how-university-students-use-claude">education</a>, and more. Additionally, we are continuously studying socio-technical alignment (what <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/values-wild">values</a> do our systems have?), and evaluating novel AI capabilities as they arise. We develop <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio">privacy-preserving tools</a> to measure AI's effects at scale, conduct mixed-methods studies of human-AI interaction, and translate research insights into actionable recommendations for both product and policy.

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
