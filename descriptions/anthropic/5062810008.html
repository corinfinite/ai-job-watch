<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic is looking for a Head of Sales and Partnerships Recruiting to lead recruiting efforts across our Sales and Partnerships organizations. This role will own recruiting across all Sales segments (SDR, Startups, Mid Market, Enterprise, and Strategic) as well as our Global Partnerships organization. You'll manage a team that includes both managers and individual contributors, and serve as a critical partner to our Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD &amp; Partnerships. This role reports to the Global Head of GTM Recruiting.</p>
<p>This is a global role. While EMEA and APAC recruiters report into regional leaders, you will own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting at a global scale, partnering closely with recruiting managers in those regions to drive consistency, share best practices, and ensure we're building a cohesive candidate and hiring manager experience worldwide.</p>
<p>We're at an inflection point. Our GTM organization is scaling 3-4x year over year, and we need a leader who can build the systems, processes, and team to support that growth while maintaining an exceptionally high bar for talent. You'll be the connective tissue between regional teams, central operations, and business leadership, ensuring we hire with both speed and precision.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build, lead, and develop a high-performing recruiting team that includes both managers and individual contributors, with a focus on coaching and scaling leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting globally, partnering with recruiting managers in EMEA and APAC to ensure consistency while allowing for regional flexibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and implement end-to-end recruiting processes that are rigorous, measurable, and built for scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop headcount forecasting models that tie directly to our revenue plan, enabling predictable hiring aligned to business growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be obsessed with quality. Champion talent density over talent mass, ensuring every hire raises the bar while still successfully delivering on headcount commitments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner closely with the Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD &amp; Partnerships as a strategic advisor on talent strategy, market insights, and pipeline health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize interview capacity and calibration across hiring teams, ensuring we use interviewer time effectively and maintain consistent evaluation standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish clear quality of hire metrics tied to performance outcomes, and use that data to continuously improve sourcing, assessment, and closing strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner closely with our Recruiting Operations team to ensure systems and tools effectively support GTM hiring goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with Compensation and HR to ensure our offers are competitive and calibrated to market, particularly for specialized or senior sales and partnerships roles</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Bring deep expertise in Sales recruiting across multiple segments and understand the nuances of hiring for transactional versus strategic, consultative roles</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Lead with low ego and high EQ, building trust across functions and coaching your team through feedback and development rather than directive management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have operated in high-growth environments and know how to build processes that scale without becoming bureaucratic</p>

<p>Are exceptional at stakeholder management, particularly with senior sales and business development leaders who have strong opinions and high expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have experience designing and refining interview processes that are both predictive and efficient</p>

<p>Can navigate global complexity, building frameworks that create consistency across regions while respecting local context and partnerships with regional leaders</p>

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
