<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role</h2>
<p>As a Product Manager in the Internal Products and Technologies organization, you'll partner with Engineering, Product, GTM, Finance, Legal, Operations, and Support to build our Revenue Platform—spanning monetization infrastructure (pricing, packaging, billing) and commercial infrastructure (enterprise contracts, deal automation, marketplace integrations) that's as ambitious as our AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>We own an expansive mix of platform, infrastructure, and product problems at the heart of Anthropic's commercial operations—building systems that support enterprise scale, global expansion, and robust financial controls.</li>
<li>Your work touches every dollar that flows through Anthropic: pricing, usage billing, seat subscriptions, enterprise contracts, cloud marketplace integrations, and global multi-entity operations.</li>
<li>You'll drive the evolution of our revenue platform to support diverse monetization models, increasingly complex enterprise needs, and the operational rigor required for a global business.</li>
<li>This means owning strategy and roadmap across pricing capabilities, commercial constructs, enterprise contract automation and platform capabilities that let product teams ship pricing changes with confidence and speed and GTM teams close deals with flexibility and speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deeply understand both internal and external customers across multiple business domains—from product, internal finance, and GTM teams to enterprise customers with complex billing needs.</li>
<li>Partnering with engineering leads to design billing capabilities and abstractions that prevent logic leakage and enable platform velocity.</li>
<li>Drive product strategy and roadmap across monetization capabilities and commercial capabilities.</li>
<li>Synthesize competing stakeholder needs and communicate prioritization clearly to senior leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>7+ years of product management experience, with deep exposure to billing systems</li>
<li>Experience taking technical software products from infancy to scale—you've built something from the ground up and grown it</li>
<li>Track record of building platform products that balance the needs of multiple users and stakeholders—you're comfortable making prioritization tradeoffs and communicating them clearly</li>
<li>Ability to internalize an entire cross-functional business and translate that into a comprehensive product vision</li>
<li>Fluent across functions—you're equally credible discussing technical architecture with engineers, financial controls with auditors, or deal mechanics with GTM leads</li>
<li>Strong instinct for connecting technical decisions to business outcomes and revenue impact</li>
<li>Scrappy and resourceful—you do what it takes to get things done</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">Strong candidates may have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built or scaled pricing/packaging capabilities that support multiple monetization models (seats, usage, credits, subscriptions) and enterprise contract complexity.</li>
<li>Quote-to-cash and ERP integration knowledge, including Salesforce/CPQ.</li>
<li>Scaled through hypergrowth (10x+ revenue)</li>
<li>Compliance expertise (SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, tax/VAT)</li>
<li>Experience transforming legacy systems into next-generation platforms</li>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.</p>
<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong> To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
