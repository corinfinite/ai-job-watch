<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the Role:</strong></h2>
<p>At Anthropic, we are pioneering new frontiers in AI that have the potential to greatly benefit society. However, developing advanced AI also comes with risks if not properly safeguarded, and we are keenly aware that our space is a target for some of the world’s most advanced adversaries. That’s why we are seeking a truly exceptional Principal Threat Intelligence Lead that will be on the front lines to develop, execute, and scale our foundational threat informed defense capabilities. You will be the key that provides actionable intelligence to protect Anthropic from the most advanced nation state attackers.</p>
<h2><strong>Responsibilities:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Build foundational threat intelligence capabilities, providing near-real-time actionable intelligence to Anthropic’s Security teams</li>
<li>Develop and deploy novel tooling to analyze and process wide range of indicators of compromise</li>
<li>Collaborate across the company to build comprehensive prevention, observability, and investigative capabilities throughout the intelligence lifecycle</li>
<li>Facilitate development of scalable, AI-leveraged solutions&nbsp;</li>
<li>Own all aspects of threat intelligence strategy, driving capability scaling and maturing the function over time</li>
<li>Produce strategic intelligence assessments for executive leadership on emerging threat actor campaigns, geopolitical developments, and industry targeting trends</li>
<li>Lead threat modeling initiatives that translate intelligence into concrete security architecture recommendations and defensive priorities</li>
<li>Build and maintain trusted external relationships with government agencies, ISACs, peer companies, and intelligence-sharing communities to ensure early warning of relevant threats</li>
<li>Partner with detection and response teams to operationalize intelligence into detection rules, hunting hypotheses, and incident response playbooks</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You may be a good fit if you have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>15+ years building and maturing threat intelligence programs at large-scale companies</li>
<li>Expert-level understanding of threat actors, their techniques, and mitigative strategies</li>
<li>Experience operating in highly targeted environments — ideally with exposure to threats facing technology companies, defense industrial base, or critical infrastructure sectors</li>
<li>Immense industry connections - you must demonstrate deep partnerships with industry threat intel teams, especially those targeted by nation state actors - when peers get hacked, you know about it (and they give you the IOCs)</li>
<li>Trusted advisor at the executive level — you have a track record of briefing C-suites, board audit committees, or senior government officials, and you know how to translate threat intelligence into business risk language that drives investment and strategic decisions</li>
<li>Builder of high-performing teams — you've recruited, developed, and retained elite threat intelligence talent in a competitive market, and analysts you've mentored have gone on to lead programs elsewhere</li>
<li>Exceptional communicator — you can translate complex technical threats into clear, actionable briefings for executives and board members, and detailed technical guidance for engineers</li>
<li>Hands-on technical depth — you're comfortable diving into malware analysis, network forensics, or log analysis when needed, not just consuming finished intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadline to apply: none. Applications will be received on a rolling basis.</p><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
