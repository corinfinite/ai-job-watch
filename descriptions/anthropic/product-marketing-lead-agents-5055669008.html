<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading">About the role</h2>
<p>We're looking for a Product Marketing Lead to own the go-to-market strategy for our first-party agent products—<a class="text-accent-secondary-100 underline" href="http://Claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude.ai</a> and Claude Code—the products that are defining how enterprises adopt AI to empower employees and transform productivity. This is a portfolio leadership role: you'll shape positioning, drive launches, and ensure our agent products work together as a cohesive offering that wins in the enterprise market.</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of product strategy and commercial execution. You'll partner deeply with Product to shape roadmaps based on market insights, with Sales to arm them with the narratives and tools they need to win, and with Marketing to amplify our story across every channel. If you've led product marketing for platform businesses, understand how to manage a portfolio of products that serve different user needs, and thrive in fast-moving environments where you can shape the trajectory of an entire business, this role is for you.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
