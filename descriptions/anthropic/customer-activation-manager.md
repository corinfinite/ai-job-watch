<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2>About the role</h2>
<p>As a Customer Activation Manager, you will be the architect of enterprise AI transformation—owning the critical first 90 days to ensure customers achieve breakthrough innovation rather than simply incremental improvement with Claude. You'll guide organizations from contract signature to production deployment across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and our API products, fundamentally changing how they work and compete.</p>
<p>This is a high-leverage role where you'll pioneer scalable activation methodologies that enable hundreds of enterprise customers to unlock transformative use cases and realize measurable business outcomes at unprecedented speed. You won't just follow playbooks—you'll design the frameworks and repeatable processes that can be deployed consistently across diverse customer environments.</p>
<p>You'll operate at the intersection of innovation strategy and hands-on execution. Your systems-thinking approach will directly shape how we activate enterprise customers, and your project management rigor will ensure every customer achieves meaningful outcomes within their first 90 days. By identifying patterns across customer activations, you'll build replicable approaches to organizational change while maintaining the agility to customize solutions for each customer's unique transformation journey.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own the complete 90-day activation journey</strong> from contract signature to production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional resources (Applied AI, Education, Support, Product) and customer teams to ensure rapid time-to-value across Claude for Enterprise, Claude Code, and API products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design and scale activation frameworks</strong> by identifying patterns across customer deployments and building templated playbooks that balance standardization with customization for breakthrough outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive organizational transformation</strong> by developing change management strategies, rollout plans, and Train-the-Trainer programs that build internal AI champions and catalyze adoption across customer organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide technical guidance and enablement</strong> by developing deep product expertise to lead admin sessions, guide implementation decisions, and translate complex AI capabilities into business value for stakeholders at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage rigorous project delivery</strong> by creating detailed plans with clear milestones, conducting 30/60/90 day business reviews, proactively mitigating risks, and ensuring every activation meets success criteria within the 90-day window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define and track success metrics</strong> across activation rate, time-to-value, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency—using data to continuously optimize the activation motion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable seamless handoffs</strong> by documenting activation journeys and expansion opportunities, preparing Account Executives and (if applicable) Customer Success Managers for long-term customer innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Channel customer insights</strong> back to Product teams, serving as voice of the customer to influence roadmap and ensure Anthropic builds what drives transformative impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be a good fit if you have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3+ years in customer-facing roles</strong> such as implementation management, technical account management, solutions consulting, or customer success—with a track record of managing multiple concurrent engagements while driving measurable outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems thinking and pattern recognition:</strong> You naturally ask "how might we scale this?" and have built repeatable processes, playbooks, or frameworks that work across different customer types—transforming 1:1 moments into scalable 1:many solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong project management and execution skills</strong> with ability to juggle concurrent customer activations, ruthlessly prioritize through a business impact lens, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical aptitude and AI enthusiasm:</strong> Ability to quickly master complex products, guide customers authoritatively on implementation decisions, and translate technical concepts into business value for audiences ranging from developers to C-suite executives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizational change and enablement experience</strong> including developing rollout strategies, navigating stakeholder resistance, building internal champions, and designing programs that drive adoption at scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comfortable building in ambiguity:</strong> This is a brand-new role—you'll thrive creating structure where none exists, adapting quickly as the business evolves, and learning continuously in a fast-paced environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-driven and metrics-oriented:</strong> Experience setting and tracking success metrics from day one, using data to optimize approaches, and demonstrating ROI to diverse stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth mindset with curiosity about AI's transformative potential</strong>—you're genuinely excited about how AI can fundamentally reshape work, workflows, and business models</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
