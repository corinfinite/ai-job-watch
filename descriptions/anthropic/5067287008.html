<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>As an External Policy &amp; Partnerships Manager on the Safeguards Outreach &amp; Partnerships team, you will own how Anthropic communicates its safety policies to the outside world and how we work with external partners to strengthen our approach. This includes maintaining and evolving our Usage Policy and other external-facing policy documents, supporting enterprise customer relationships alongside our Sales/Go-to-Market and Legal teams, driving transparency efforts like model cards and public reporting, and building external partnerships that inform our policy development and safety practices.</p>
<p>You'll serve as a bridge between internal policy development and external stakeholders—translating nuanced safety decisions into clear, consistent language for users, customers, and regulators. Commercial teams will see you as a key partner navigating customer questions about our policies, detection systems, and enforcement practices. You'll manage expert relationships that inform our policies and interventions, coordinate research partnerships that establish best practices in AI safety, and oversee vendor relationships that power key safety features.</p>
<p>This is a role for someone who can operate across legal, policy, partnership, and commercial contexts while maintaining a clear through-line on Anthropic's safety commitments.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
