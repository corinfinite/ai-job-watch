<h3><strong>Enterprise and Verticals</strong></h3>
<p>You will partner closely with product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to drive growth in Anthropic's enterprise business and accelerate adoption of Claude products. In this role you’ll also partner with teams building products like Claude for Excel for verticals outside of Coding. You'll surface insights about how enterprises adopt and scale our products across diverse use cases, measure the impact of vertical-specific features, and drive data-informed decisions that shape our enterprise growth strategy and our expansion into new markets. This role offers a unique opportunity to work across the full breadth of Anthropic's product portfolio through the lens of businesses.</p>
<h3><strong>Enterprise Code</strong></h3>
<p>You will partner closely with product, engineering, growth, and go-to-market teams to turbocharge adoption of Anthropic's suite of coding tools among Enterprises.

Help to shape how enterprises integrate AI into their software development workflows, partnering across marketing, growth, and product to turn groundswell developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise-wide adoption.</p>
<h3><strong>Claude Code</strong></h3>
<p>This role is embedded with the Claude Code product team, driving data-informed decisions for Anthropic's agentic coding tool that enables developers to delegate coding tasks directly to Claude from their terminal. You'll help the team understand how developers interact with AI coding assistants, measure developer productivity and product quality, and identify opportunities to innovate the developer experience as the product scales. Key focus areas include developer usage patterns across the platform, driving adoption within the developer ecosystem, and developer segmentation.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
