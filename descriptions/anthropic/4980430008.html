<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><div>
<h2>About the role:</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"</p>
<p>The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg">this introduction to Interpretability</a> from our research lead, <a href="https://colah.github.io/about.html">Chris Olah</a>; a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU">discussion of our work</a> on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork">Hard Fork podcast</a> produced by the New York Times, and this <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability">blog post</a> (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team's notable publications include <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html">A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html">In-context Learning and Induction Heads</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/">Scaling Monosemanticity</a>, and our Circuits’ <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html">Methods</a> and <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html">Biology</a> papers. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/">original circuits thread</a>, <a href="https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/">Multimodal Neurons</a>, <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/">Activation Atlases</a>, and <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">Building Blocks</a>.</p>
<p>We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html">vision post</a>). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>, <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html">Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent</a>, and our <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html">May 2023 update</a>), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model">work</a> found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.</p>
<p>We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/april-update/index.html#interpretability-architecture">Interpretability Architectures project</a> that involves collaborating with Pretraining.</p>

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
