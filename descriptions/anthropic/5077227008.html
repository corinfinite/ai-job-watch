<div class="content-intro"><h2><strong>About Anthropic</strong></h2>
<p>Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.</p></div><h2 class="heading"><strong>About the role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Content Designer on the Enterprise Growth team, you'll shape how the world's most sophisticated organizations understand and adopt Claude. You'll work across product, marketing, and sales to design content experiences for enterprise decision-makers in finance, sales operations, and life sciences—industries where precision, trust, and compliance aren't negotiable.</p>
<p>This role sits at the intersection of strategy and craft. You'll translate Claude's capabilities into value propositions that land differently for a CFO evaluating AI for financial analysis than for a pharma researcher assessing tools for literature review. You'll build the content foundations—voice, positioning, educational materials—that help enterprises trust AI in high-stakes contexts. And you'll execute across the full journey: thought leadership, sales enablement, product onboarding, and customer success.</p>
<p>You'll also use Claude as a core part of how you work—writing, thinking, prototyping—and bring what you learn back into the content you create for customers.</p>
<h2 class="heading"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Own content strategy for enterprise growth across finance, healthcare, and life sciences—shaping how regulated industries understand Claude's unique value proposition around capability, safety, and trust</li>
<li>Use Claude extensively in your own work: writing, ideating, testing, and refining. Model the AI fluency we want to help enterprise customers build, and bring those insights back into the content you create</li>
<li>Design whole content experiences. Prototype in Figma, collaborate closely with engineering, and be comfortable enough with code to understand how your content surfaces in the product</li>
<li>Develop prompts, interaction patterns, and educational content that help enterprise users get value from Claude quickly—teaching people to think with AI, not just use it</li>
<li>Add to our scalable content systems—agents, frameworks, tools—that maintain quality at velocity without becoming bottlenecks</li>
<li>Design onboarding experiences and best practice guides that accelerate time-to-value</li>
<li>Shape product experiences that feel native to enterprise contexts, collaborating cross-functionally to ensure terminology, flows, and interactions land with sophisticated buyers</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What we're looking for:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>6+ years in content design, UX writing, or content strategy, with at least 3 years focused on B2B or enterprise products</li>
<li>Genuine curiosity about AI and how it changes your craft. You use Claude (or other LLMs) in your actual work as a thinking partner. You have opinions about what outputs are good enough, where it falls short, and how to bridge that gap</li>
<li>Comfort with code. You don't need to be an engineer, but you can read a codebase, ship small changes, and collaborate fluently with developers</li>
<li>Strong prototyping instincts and fluency in Figma. You think in interactions</li>
<li>Experience developing content for complex technical products and sophisticated buyers—fintech, dev tools, healthcare, or similar</li>
<li>Understanding of enterprise buying journeys and the ability to craft content that works for end users, practitioners, and executives simultaneously</li>
<li>Portfolio that shows strategic thinking, clear writing for technical audiences, and content that moved business metrics</li>
<li>Track record of building from scratch. You've created content systems, not just inherited them. You're energized by ambiguity, not paralyzed by it</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Strong candidates may also have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience in regulated industries or with compliance-sensitive content</li>
<li>Background in sales enablement or solutions marketing</li>
<li>History of conducting user research and customer interviews to shape content strategy</li>
</ul><div class="content-pay-transparency"><div class="pay-input"><div class="description"><p>The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Education requirements: </strong>We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.<strong><br><br>Location-based hybrid policy:</strong> Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

<p><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Visa sponsorship:</strong>&nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.<br><br><strong data-stringify-type="bold">Your safety matters to us.</strong>&nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&nbsp;@anthropic.com&nbsp;email addresses.

<h2><strong>How we're different</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>
